Unless a subtitle's `readme.md` says otherwise, you are free to use these files as you wish, no credit required  

I recommend using [arch1t3cht's fork of Aegisub](https://github.com/arch1t3cht/Aegisub).

I also use [assfonts](https://github.com/wyzdwdz/assfonts) to embed fonts into subtitle files.

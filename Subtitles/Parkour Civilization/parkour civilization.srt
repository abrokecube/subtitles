1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Let's go, open up. It's time for parkour.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,540
All right, time for my mandatory parkour check.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,500
Let's get this over with.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,040
You're late. You know the deal.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,150
You can do the one-block jump for the raw chicken,

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,830
or you can attempt the one-block 
vertical jump for the beef.

7
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,160
Here in Parkour Civilization, 
no one chooses to jump for the beef.

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,920
It's better to be safe and do 
the one-block jump for the chicken

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,180
rather than risk your entire life 
for just half-a-hunger-bar more.

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,210
Tomorrow, you better not be late, or you'll be 
doing two-block jumps as punishment.

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,970
Yes, sir. Sorry, I won't be late next time.

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,910
Down here, us Parkour Noobs 
only get fed once a day.

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,990
One piece of raw chicken is 
just enough to get you to the next day.

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,410
But that's the life of Parkour Civilization.

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,680
If you wanna survive, you have to parkour.

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,610
Every Parkour Noob has the same goal, 
and that's to make it to the top layer

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,390
where all the Parkour Pros live.

18
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,060
Except most Parkour Pros are born on the top layer.

19
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,710
If you're a Parkour Noob, there's only one way up.

20
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,720
And that is through the Temple of Parkour.

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,520
The Temple of Parkour is 
the only structure in the world

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,780
that combines the bottom layer to the top layer.

23
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,950
To make it up, you have to do
 an impossibly hard parkour course

24
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,200
that no Parkour Noob has ever completed.

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,510
And that's assuming you even 
get the chance to complete the course.

26
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,120
The inside of the Temple is protected by a barrier,

27
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,890
and the only way a Parkour Noob 
gets past the barrier

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,290
is if they've earned a ticket.

29
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,150
I've never even tried getting a ticket before,

30
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,820
but if I'm gonna rank up to a 
Parkour Pro one day, I'm gonna have to.

31
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,730
In my neighborhood, pretty much everyone 
has fallen into the void and died,

32
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,370
except for the guy who lives right next to me.

33
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,110
He's been my neighbor for five years.

34
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:23,900
NOOOO!

35
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,660
Why did he try going for the beef?

36
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,470
Well, I guess I have to change my statement.

37
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,220
I now live in this neighborhood alone.

38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,470
In Parkour Civilization, only Parkour Pros
 are allowed to break or place blocks.

39
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,970
For Parkour Noobs, it's strictly prohibited.

40
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,070
And unfortunately, I found that out the hard way.

41
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,070
A while ago, I was searching around 
and I somehow stumbled upon an oak log.

42
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,410
No one has seen an oak log in years 
since trees don't exist in Parkour Civilization.

43
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,600
So I had to try to take it.

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,500
Stop right now.

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,610
Oh, no, I'm done for.

46
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,850
You really thought you could 
break that without me noticing?

47
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,850
What, were you gonna try to cheat parkour?

48
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,500
No, sir, I didn't try to cheat.

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,990
I just thought it would be 
super rare and I wanted to collect it.

50
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,790
Stop talking. Give me two jumps now.

51
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,960
Two jumps in a row?

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,760
Okay, sorry, sir. I'll do it right now.

53
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,840
You know what? You seem 
a little too happy about two.

54
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,680
Let's make it three.

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,230
Okay, I'll do three.

56
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,380
You know what? Now let's 
make it four jumps in a row!

57
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,180
Ugh, four in a row? Come on!

58
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,870
In Parkour Civilization, it should be no surprise that

59
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,390
all punishments were just more forms of parkour.

60
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,300
And that was the last time 
I ever tried breaking a block.

61
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,430
You're lucky you got a light punishment.

62
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,160
Don't forget, you're at 
the bottom, so follow the rules.

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,680
It's safe to say that if you're at 
the bottom level of Parkour Civilization,

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,020
it's not exactly the best.

65
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,500
But not everything in 
Parkour Civilization is that bad.

66
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,670
For example, I was able to use parkour

67
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,450
to buy the biggest house in the neighborhood.

68
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,470
In Parkour Civilization, 
literally everything is parkour,

69
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,640
and that means parkour has replaced money.

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,390
Welcome!

71
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,850
Choose which house you wanna buy.

72
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,400
It's pretty nice. In Parkour Civilization, 
all you have to do to buy anything

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,150
is just make more parkour jumps.

74
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,900
I'm not really sure why or how 
parkour works as a currency,

75
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,190
but all I know is I basically bought 
a two-story house for free.

76
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,880
Somehow when I was buying my house,

77
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,980
I convinced myself to go for 
the ladder jump to buy the bigger house.

78
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,630
In Parkour Civilization, parkour jumps with 
trickier items like ladders are worth more.

79
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,980
That's why this jump basically 
bought me a mansion.

80
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,970
No way!

81
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,540
Thank you for buying the big house.

82
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,520
Let me take you right to it. Just follow me.

83
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,020
Let's go! This is awesome. 
I just bought my first house.

84
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,890
All houses in Parkour Civilization are pre-built,

85
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,730
and they all have one thing in common.

86
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,040
It's a requirement that every single house has

87
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,410
a parkour jump inside to get to your bed.

88
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,470
This is a way to make sure 
everyone in Parkour Civilization

89
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,390
parkours everywhere they go, even inside the house.

90
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,460
So, this is the neighborhood you'll be living in.

91
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,400
You're the only two-story house here.

92
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,640
So if you follow me, I'll give you a house tour.

93
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,890
This is so sick.

94
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,780
That ladder jump literally may be the richest one in the neighborhood.

95
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,170
As you can see, you have a jump on the top floor

96
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,680
and a jump on the bottom floor.

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,450
Let me show you the upstairs, 
and then the house is all yours.

98
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,130
All right. I mean, everything looks good.

99
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,840
I just have to do this jump to my bed.

100
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,820
Uh, yeah, I think I got everything figured out.

101
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,160
Perfect. Last thing,

102
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,330
I just need to check if your parkour jump is good.

103
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,860
How are you supposed to check if it's good?

104
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,680
Wait, what the?

105
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,420
Did this guy for real just jump off?

106
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,080
Uh, I'm really confused. Is he alive?

107
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Why did he do that?

108
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,410
All right, just wanted to confirm that 
your house is ready to move in.

109
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,150
The guy did in fact die, 
so everything should be good.

110
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,590
That guy seriously died?

111
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,650
Yeah, don't worry about it. 
It's a part of the job.

112
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,430
Enjoy your house.

113
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,440
How is that a part of the job? What?

114
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,660
No one really remembers 
how Parkour Civilization started.

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,090
Most of the Parkour Noobs down here 
at least think that

116
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,070
the Parkour Pros were the ones who started it.

117
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,550
But the truth is, I think I was the one who started it.

118
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,410
For some reason I can't remember the best,

119
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,810
but I'm pretty sure this is how the story went.

120
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,410
Yo, Seawatt.

121
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,060
Yo. Hello?

122
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,750
Bro, you think I could get a diamond real quick?

123
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,300
I was mining for like three hours 
and I only found two diamonds.

124
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,720
I just wanna make a diamond pickaxe.

125
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,350
Uhh, sorry. Don't have any to spare.

126
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,650
Bro come on, don't be like that. You were literally just holding one.

127
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,520
Dude, just give me one and I'll pay you back later.

128
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,500
I just need a pickaxe.

129
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,260
All right, fine. Give me one second.

130
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,430
If you want a diamond, you gotta give me something.

131
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,650
All right, watch out. Back up for one second.

132
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,160
Look, if you can make this four-block jump, 
I'll pay you one diamond.

133
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,370
Make this four-block jump—wait, why?

134
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,010
Why are you gonna pay me to do parkour?

135
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,820
What do you even gain from this?

136
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,320
Uh, I don't know. I've just 
never seen anyone do it before.

137
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,500
I'd pay to see it done.

138
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,120
Ahaha, okay, I'll take the offer.

139
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,440
Oh, this is so annoying. 
All right, just give me a second.

140
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,160
I know it's possible. I've done it before.

141
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,040
I told you, bro. It's not possible.

142
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,760
Just stop talking and watch.

143
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,570
I'm gonna do it in like 30 seconds.

144
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,750
And there we go. Finally.

145
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,170
Look, I told you it was possible.

146
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,760
No way! That was actually incredible!

147
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,930
All right, well, I got my money's worth.

148
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,550
Let's go! I got paid for parkour.

149
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,120
If you want, I can keep making more 
parkour for you to do, and I'll pay you for it.

150
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,040
Are you kidding? Dude, totally.

151
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,080
All right, I'll be back here tomorrow, I guess.

152
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,980
And this is basically how 
parkouring for money started.

153
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,280
The next day I showed up to Seawatt's house,
 he offered me way more diamonds this time,

154
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,920
and he constructed an entire parkour course 
outside of his house to do.

155
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,560
But little did we know that 
this parkour course would completely change

156
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,000
the way that the world works.

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,490
Soon after this event, 
the Parkour Civilization began.

158
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,240
Now that I think about it, 
there's kind of an unexplainable gap

159
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,550
between those events and now, but oh well.

160
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,880
Parkour check time. You got 30 seconds.

161
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,520
Another beautiful morning and I have to parkour for

162
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,980
some more raw chicken 
that will make me starve even more.

163
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,430
All right, all right, I'm here.

164
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,280
One block for raw chicken, 
one-block vertical for beef.

165
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,370
What are you choosing today?

166
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,860
Considering my neighbor 
just died for going for the beef,

167
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm just gonna go with the chicken again.

168
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,410
Keep in mind, there's a ticket event today.

169
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,330
It's gonna be about 200 blocks west.

170
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,560
This was huge news.

171
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,030
If there actually was a ticket event today,
 I would need to go for the beef.

172
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,330
Ticket events are usually far away, and I would 
starve by the time I got there if I chose the chicken.

173
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,950
But luckily, I got the beef.

174
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,920
No way. You made that jump?

175
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,870
You might become a Parkour Pro one day.

176
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,760
Wait, you really think 
I could rank up to be a Parkour Pro?

177
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,510
Ha! Not a chance. You're a Parkour Noob.

178
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,890
You guys never rank up.

179
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,020
It's important to know 
that Parkour Pros have really big egos,

180
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,890
and they like to put down the Parkour Noobs.

181
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,220
This was an important day.

182
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,000
This was only the second time I've jumped for the beef

183
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,150
and now I have a chance to earn a ticket.

184
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,600
The ticket events are so risky 
because they're located so far away.

185
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,130
If I wasn't paying attention, 
I could miss just one of these one-block jumps

186
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,380
and my entire chances of 
becoming a Parkour Pro would be over.

187
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,430
But luckily, I made it to the ticket event.

188
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,910
When I got here, there were only three Parkour Noobs

189
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,550
in line to do the parkour course.

190
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,210
Most Noobs don't even 
show up for the courses anymore,

191
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,520
because if you miss one jump, 
you end up like this guy.

192
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,700
And that's the price you pay 
if you want a ticket to be a Parkour Pro.

193
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,990
I watched as the second Noob fell to the void.

194
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,560
Hey man, do you think you could go already?

195
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,420
I don't know, man. I'm kinda nervous I'm gonna fall.

196
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,350
No, you don't need to be nervous. 
I'm sure you're fi—

197
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,400
Oh, shoot.

198
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,110
Okay?

199
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,020
Never mind then.

200
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,920
Before going for it, 
I wanted to study the parkour course.

201
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,640
You see, every week the ticket challenge changes,
 and it's completely random.

202
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,190
And this week's course was extremely difficult.

203
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:46,100
There was a two-block jump to get to the ticket, 
and if you get it, a two-block jump to get out of it.

204
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,030
Here's the thing about Parkour Civilization. 
parkour can be used for anything,

205
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,090
and that includes bribing Parkour Pros.

206
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,790
Check this out. If I do a parkour jump with the 360,

207
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,760
will you replace one of the two-block jumps 
with a one-block jump?

208
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,760
You wanna do a one-block jump with a 360?

209
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,190
Fine. There's no way 
you're gonna make it, but I'll accept.

210
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,610
Let's go! The Parkour Pro accepted by bribe.

211
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,430
And now I have another problem. I have to do a 360.

212
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,850
Have I even done this before?

213
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,940
Whatever, I'm just gonna go for it. Please make it.

214
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,710
No way. I actually did it.

215
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,200
All right? Deal's a deal, right?

216
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,810
I'm not gonna lie. That was the 
coolest thing I've seen a Parkour Noob do.

217
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,970
Well, the deal's a deal. Here you go.

218
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,280
Let's go. Now there was only 
one two-block jump in the course.

219
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,560
Still gotta make the first two-block jump, Noob.

220
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,470
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

221
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,770
Just let me do the course, bro.

222
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,180
This was my best chance to finally earn a ticket.

223
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,880
If I actually get this ticket, 
I could access the Parkour Temple

224
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,260
and make my way up into 
a better life as a Parkour Pro.

225
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,170
There was no turning back now. 
I had to start the course.

226
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:45,960
Most Parkour Noobs aren't experienced with 
diagonal jumps, but somehow I got past it.

227
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,250
And now was the two-block jump. 
This was life or death.

228
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,490
I closed my eyes and I went for it.

229
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,720
I expected to be falling thousands of feet per second into the void,

230
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,150
but to my surprise, I was standing on 
the platform with the ticket.

231
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,020
And thanks to the deal I made with the Parkour Pro, 
I only had a one-block jump to get out of the course.

232
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,380
This was life-changing.

233
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,570
This was the first time I've ever received 
a ticket to access the Parkour Temple,

234
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,920
and I promised myself that I wasn't gonna waste it.

235
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,960
I made my way over to the Parkour Temple.

236
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,070
I was in a good spot.

237
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,920
I had three full hunger bars, which is 
the most hunger a Parkour Noob can have.

238
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,640
This was it.

239
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,500
There was no better time, no more perfect time

240
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,160
to try making the parkour course 
to rank up to a Parkour Pro.

241
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,690
I walked up to the hoppers in the ground 
and I threw in my ticket.

242
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,310
After a few seconds, the invisible barrier 
that guards the Parkour Temple was down.

243
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,340
And now, of course, I had to make sure I didn't

244
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,040
fail the one-block jump to actually get inside the Temple.

245
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,050
I made the one-block jump successfully
 and now I was officially inside the Temple.

246
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,780
This was it.

247
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,860
This was the moment 
I've been waiting for my entire life.

248
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,310
This was the parkour course that 
no Parkour Noob has ever beaten.

249
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,410
If you miss any of these jumps, you'll either 
die from fall damage or fall directly into the void.

250
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,300
But I've come too far and I've 
practiced too much to have that happen.

251
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,470
I wasn't just gonna be 
another Parkour Noob that fails this course.

252
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,980
I was gonna be the first one 
to rank up to become a Parkour Pro.

253
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,410
My journey to becoming a Parkour Pro starts n—

254
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,390
Hey. Wake up.

255
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,250
You want a chance to eat today or what?

256
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,020
All right, let's get this over with.

257
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's go!

258
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,110
Hurry up and do the parkour, Noob.

259
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,590
Down here in Parkour Prison, 
even the cells have one-block jumps.

260
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,670
if you miss a single jump or if a Parkour Pro 
catches you not jumping for 30 seconds,

261
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,190
you'll be thrown into the lava.

262
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,120
All right, I gotta ask, do you wanna do a diagonal jump

263
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,900
to reduce your prison sentence time?

264
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,290
Most Parkour Noobs would never take this deal.

265
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,550
Diagonal jumps are just not worth the risk.

266
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,800
But I wasn't just gonna 
sit in Parkour Prison my entire life.

267
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,360
If there was any chance I could get out sooner, 
I was gonna take it.

268
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,790
That was unexpected.

269
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,480
Congrats. You've earned 
one day off your prison time.

270
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:56,840
That means you go from 49 years and 320 days 
to 49 years and 319 days left.

271
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,960
And this is how my life is gonna be for 
the next 49 years in Parkour Prison.

272
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,250
That is, unless I find a way to get to that portal 
and make my way back to Parkour Civilization.

273
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,650
Parkour Prison is located directly under 
the bottom layer of Parkour Civilization.

274
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,980
If a Parkour Noob misses any jump, they fall into the void and end up here.

275
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,790
And the only way back to civilization is 
to spend 50 years here without failing a jump.

276
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,560
Before I was sent here,
 I never knew this place existed.

277
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,470
And I was so close to becoming a Parkour Pro.

278
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,120
My entire life, I've been training for one goal,

279
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,060
and that's to go to the Temple of Parkour 
and complete the impossible course

280
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,090
to rank up to become a Parkour Pro.

281
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,990
I had everything.

282
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,200
I earned the ticket to get inside the Temple,
 and I had enough food to make the journey.

283
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,940
But when the time came, I failed the first jump.

284
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,500
And now I'm dea—

285
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,680
What the...

286
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,960
Where am I?

287
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,370
Welcome to Parkour Prison, or as 
most Noobs call it, their worst nightmare.

288
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,990
If you'll just follow me, I'll take you right to your cell.

289
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,000
Parkour Prison?
If you'll just follow me, I'll take you right to your cell.

290
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,460
Parkour Prison?

291
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,080
What is this place?

292
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,580
I don't get it. How am I still alive?

293
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,920
Hey, and, uh, just make sure you don't
 miss any of these one-block jumps,

294
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,990
'cause if you fall in the lava, 
you <i>will</i> die for real this time.

295
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,240
Oh, yeah, not a problem. I've never 
missed a one-block jump in my life.

296
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,240
What I didn't get is why Parkour Prison existed.

297
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,240
Instead of letting the Parkour Noobs 
just fall into the void,

298
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,630
somehow this massive structure was 
made under the void to catch us, but why?

299
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,890
All right, Noob, this is your cell. Go on in.

300
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,730
All of the cells in Parkour Prison 
were separated by a three-block gap,

301
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,430
meaning once I went inside this cell, 
I would never be able to escape.

302
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,780
But that wasn't gonna stop me from trying.

303
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,360
Make sure you're doing at least 
one jump in your cell every 30 seconds.

304
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,720
If one of us catches you not jumping, 
you're not making it out of here.

305
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,560
Just minutes before this, I was 
about to rank up to be a Parkour Pro,

306
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,350
and now I'm in the most dangerous place 
in Parkour Civilization.

307
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,880
As far as I'm concerned, I'm 
the only Noob right now in Parkour Prison.

308
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,630
My guess is most of them by now fell in the lava.

309
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,910
Wait, there's actually someone here.

310
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,760
Let's go! I'm not alone down here.

311
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,050
Wait, why does this guy look familiar?

312
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,850
<i>He's been my neighbor for five years.</i>

313
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,650
<i>NOOO!</i>

314
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,400
<i>Why did he try going for the beef?</i>

315
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,810
No way, it is my neighbor!

316
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,450
Wow, I'm so glad I'm not alone down here. I just—

317
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,200
NOOO!

318
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,870
Dude, what is wrong with this guy?

319
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,280
All right, he has to be doing it on purpose at this point.

320
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,590
The only thing that's better about Parkour Prison is 
they feed us fish instead of raw chicken.

321
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,040
Hey, Noob, let's go.

322
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,930
You've been selected for parkour testing.

323
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,600
Be down there in 30 seconds.

324
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,300
And this is one of the not so good parts about prison.

325
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,830
The random parkour testing.

326
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,680
Bro, wait, you didn't even fill in this gap.

327
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,370
Ah man, now I gotta do another one-block jump.

328
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,860
If you're a prisoner here, 
the only thing you hope for is

329
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,870
that you don't get selected 
for random parkour testing.

330
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,150
Every few days, the Pros will pick a Noob at random 
to test out a new course they've built.

331
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,430
This time, the course I was selected for
 had fence parkour.

332
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,320
If I failed to make this one-block fence jump, 
I wouldn't be coming back.

333
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,070
Let's go. We don't have all day. Get on the course.

334
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,560
Yes, sir. I'm going right now.

335
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,170
The worst part about these random courses is that 
they intentionally use harder blocks for the jumps.

336
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,680
The Pros know that the Noobs have 
almost no experience with fence jumps,

337
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,070
but they build them anyways.

338
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,190
All right, testing complete. 
Back to your cell in 30 seconds.

339
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,800
By some miracle, I was able to get past 
this week's random testing course.

340
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,090
But what about the next week 
or the week after that?

341
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,990
There's gonna be some day when 
they build a jump that I can't do.

342
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,130
And I need to get out of here before that happens.

343
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,770
Luckily, I've been thinking of 
a plan to make my escape.

344
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:20,710
Back in Parkour Civilization, 
I used parkour to bribe one of the pros.

345
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,360
And now I was gonna do it again.

346
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,970
Hey, guard.

347
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,290
What do you want, Noob?

348
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,110
I got something to show you.
 Can you come over here?

349
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,190
This better be worth my time 
or I'm not feeding you tomorrow.

350
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,150
Okay, what?

351
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,140
Oh, nothing really. I just wanted to ask you 
if I could pay you in, uh,

352
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,370
three diagonal jumps in a row 
for five minutes of free time?

353
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,110
Three? In a row?

354
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,830
Yep, three in a row. What do you think?

355
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:45,050
You're definitely not making that,
 but it's not like I care anyways. Sure.

356
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,450
Like always, parkour can be used 
to get out of any situation.

357
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:53,130
But now I had one chance to make 
three diagonal jumps in a row, or else I was dead.

358
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:53,780
Come on.

359
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,690
One, two, three!

360
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,760
Oh, wait. I actually did it.

361
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,620
Okay. Five minutes of free time,

362
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,570
but you better be back in your cell 
by the time I get back.

363
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,490
The bribe worked.

364
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,290
Now I had five minutes to roam around 
Parkour Prison to see if I could find a way to escape.

365
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,300
I had no clue what was gonna 
happen to me after I escaped,

366
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,370
but I didn't have time to think about that right now.

367
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,020
When I jumped around the prison, 
I noticed someone doing the random testing course.

368
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,410
Wait, is that who I think it is?

369
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,200
<i>No, you don't need to be nervous. I'm sure you're fi—</i>

370
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,150
<i>Oh!</i>

371
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,770
No way, it is the guy 
who failed the ticket event in front of me.

372
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,730
That guy was nice. I hope he clutches up 
these glass jumps and makes it back to civilizat—

373
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,240
Oh!

374
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,680
Something was strange about this testing course.

375
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,690
Why were they using glass for parkour?

376
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,740
Glass jumps aren't even a thing 
at the Parkour Noob level.

377
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,990
If Noobs have never done glass jumps, 
why would they use them to test the jumps?

378
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,880
I just gotta get out of—

379
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,430
I bet you're trying to think of a plan to escape. right?

380
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,390
What? Escape? What are you talking about?

381
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,870
I would never try to escape.

382
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,710
You're not?

383
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,900
I was gonna take you to the portal, 
but, if you don't want to...

384
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,660
This obviously seems like you're trying to set me up.

385
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,030
It's not a setup.

386
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,000
No one says you have to stay here.
 You can leave at any time.

387
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,830
Just follow me and I'll take you there.

388
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,350
I'm 99% sure I'm being led into a trap, 
but it doesn't matter.

389
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,960
If he gets me close to the portal, I'll try to improvise.

390
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,310
If this guard was leading me into a trap, 
I couldn't see what it was.

391
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,640
He was already getting me so close to the portal.

392
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,630
At this point, I was just gonna have to take a chance 
and hope that he was telling me the truth.

393
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,170
I was now five blocks away 
from going back to Parkour Civilization.

394
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,040
You can leave now. If you accept the terms 
that you can never earn a ticket

395
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,080
to rank up to become a Parkour Pro 
for the rest of your life.

396
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,660
Wait, you're saying if I go back to Parkour Civilization now,

397
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,490
I can never be a Parkour Pro?

398
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,160
That's correct.

399
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,760
Or you can wait out the remainder 
of your 49 years here in prison.

400
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,090
So this was the catch.

401
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:44,070
I could leave Parkour Prison right now, 
but in return, I could never become a Parkour Pro.

402
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,610
Or I could try to survive here for another 49 years.

403
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,350
It wasn't worth it to stay.
 I needed to get out of here.

404
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,880
Okay, I've made my decision. I'm gonna go back.

405
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
So you accept? Good luck.

406
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,560
This was it. The work was done.

407
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,540
I escaped Parkour Prison. But at what cost?

408
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,080
Leaving now meant that 
I would be a Noob for the rest of my life.

409
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,550
When I went through the portal, 
I was brought back into Parkour Civilization.

410
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,560
The portal spawned me at the entrance of the Temple of Parkour.

411
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,220
This was probably the last time 
I would ever step foot in this Temple.

412
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,450
I had my chance to rank up 
to become a Pro and I failed.

413
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,060
Now I can never earn a ticket ever again.

414
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,780
You know, it's not the worst thing in the world.

415
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,660
Now I can just go back to 
my ordinary life in Parkour Civilization.

416
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,840
You know, now that I think about it,
 it's not the worst situation in the world.

417
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,610
I mean, at least I still have my mansio—

418
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,900
Wait, who is this?

419
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,720
I still own this house, right?

420
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,720
No, you don't. This house no longer belongs to you.

421
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,300
This Parkour Noob just purchased this new mansion.

422
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,780
So you'll have to leave now.

423
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,750
Wait, wait, wait, this guy just 
bought my house? How can he do that?

424
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,490
Well, you fell and went to Parkour Prison,
 so you lost the house.

425
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,920
When you were down there,
 this Parkour Noob bought it.

426
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,910
Bro, really? Wow, so I 
really don't own this house anymore.

427
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,300
Well, this guy can enjo—

428
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,320
Uh...

429
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,920
Okay, it's for sale now.

430
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,290
Let's go! So I can move back into my house?

431
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,070
After you buy it again, sure.

432
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,680
Wait, really? Are you serious? I have to buy it again?

433
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,110
I went back to the shop to go buy my mansion again,

434
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,910
but while I was at Parkour Prison, 
something bad happened.

435
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,650
The prices for houses 
in my neighborhood went way up.

436
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,070
Now, if I wanted to buy my mansion, 
I would have had to pay for it with a two-block jump.

437
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,920
It was too risky. I was gonna have 
to find somewhere else to live.

438
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,000
Fortunately, I found another shop 
that was selling wood houses,

439
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,300
a bit of a downgrade from the stone house, 
but it was all I could afford.

440
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,160
I could either do a one-block 
fence jump for a small house

441
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,090
or a one-and-a-half block 
stair jump for a large house.

442
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,390
I figured if I'm gonna be living on 
the noob level for my entire life,

443
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,870
I might as well buy the big house.

444
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,890
Luckily, escaping Parkour Prison gave me 
the confidence to make the jump easily.

445
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,660
Now, I got a mansion in a new neighborhood 
where, not to my surprise,

446
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,300
everyone fell into the void, so it's just me living here.

447
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,440
The house is definitely a bit of a downgrade 
from my previous mansion,

448
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,570
but it's still a two-story house, 
and it has a painting, which is

449
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,420
something you don't really see that often 
in Parkour Civilization.

450
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,820
I just keep wondering what my life would have been like

451
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,410
if I actually made it to the Pro civilization.

452
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,090
Now, I don't think I'll ever figure out 
what it looks like up there. I just wish that—

453
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:03,550
Whoa!

454
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,910
What was that?

455
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,770
When I went to sit in my chair, 
I backed up against the wall,

456
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,190
and there was nothing behind me.

457
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,040
This painting was covering something.

458
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,980
I walked through the painting, 
and it revealed a secret door.

459
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,910
For some reason, this house I bought 
had some hidden passage.

460
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,740
Whoever made this was obviously 
trying to hide something.

461
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,680
But what was it? There was 
a ladder that led to the bottom floor,

462
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,050
and when I got down there, I found a man.

463
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,240
Somehow there was already someone living here.

464
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,970
By their leather boots, I could tell 
it was a Parkour Noob.

465
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,960
This was obviously some mistake. 
I went to go leave, but then...

466
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,920
Wait, don't leave.

467
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,680
The man spoke to me. 
He said he's been watching me.

468
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,860
I watched you enter the Temple of Parkour.

469
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,910
I think you have what it takes to rank up.

470
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,880
I'm sorry, man. I think you're confused.

471
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,480
I can never earn a ticket anymore.

472
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,820
I'm... gonna be a Parkour Noob forever.

473
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,950
No. There is still a way I can get you a ticket.

474
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,410
Wait, wait, wait. What are you talking about?

475
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,000
When I was younger, 
I earned myself a ticket, but I never used it.

476
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,200
Instead, I hid it far, far away.

477
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,550
The old man said it wasn't his destiny
 to rank up to be a Pro, but it was mine.

478
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,760
He brought out a compass and he threw it to me.

479
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,900
He told me that if I followed this compass, 
I'll find the hidden ticket.

480
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,350
This was the second chance I was looking for.

481
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,680
I had no way of knowing whether 
the old man was telling the truth or not,

482
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,860
but at this point, I had nothing to lose.

483
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,500
Maybe this works, maybe it doesn't.

484
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,310
All I know is that I wasn't done 
with Parkour Civilization just yet.

485
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,190
Come on, just one jump at a time 
and I should be there soon.

486
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,240
Where do you think you're going?

487
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,550
Oh, this can't be good.

488
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,190
This is a parkour checkpoint.

489
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,120
Why do you wanna leave Parkour Civilization?

490
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,990
If the Pro found out why I was really out here,
 I might go back to Parkour Prison.

491
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,470
I was gonna need an excuse.

492
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,790
I, uh, just wanted to practice my two-block jumps.

493
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,530
Listen, Noob.

494
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,200
Out there, you'd never survive.

495
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,320
Besides, what do you need to practice for?

496
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,630
You can never rank up, buddy.

497
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,060
Despite my convincing story, it didn't work.

498
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,420
I was in big trouble now.

499
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,850
Following this compass is the only possible way

500
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,520
I can make it up to the Parkour Pro civilization.

501
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,510
I was gonna have to try something else.

502
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,760
I told you to go home.

503
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,070
What if I paid you with a backwards jump?

504
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,280
A backwards jump?

505
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,210
Okay, at least he's listening, 
and now I get one chance at this.

506
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,270
Oh my god, I actually made it.

507
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,310
That was crazy.

508
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,160
Wait, no, that was crazy.

509
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,750
Move aside and let me try this.

510
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,560
You got it. Just make sure you jump far enou—

511
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,080
Oh, shoot.

512
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,330
That was not my plan.

513
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,010
I thought he was just gonna let me pass.

514
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,960
Uh, all right, well I guess that works.

515
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,120
Now that I made it past the parkour checkpoint,

516
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,450
it was time to go searching for the hidden ticket.

517
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,160
That's assuming that 
the ticket I'm looking for is even real.

518
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,660
After the mysterious old man gave me this compass 
and told me that it would lead to a ticket

519
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,470
to rank up to Parkour Pro civilization, 
I immediately started preparing for the journey

520
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,600
because this time I wasn't gonna fail.

521
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,540
The biggest problem I had to solve 
was my food supply.

522
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,810
Parkour Noobs only get fed once a day.

523
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,040
And if this compass was taking me far away,

524
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,300
there was no way I would 
survive on the raw chicken.

525
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,860
So for the past week, I've been doing 
the beef jump every single morning.

526
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,920
And for the rest of the day, I tried not to 
parkour at all so I could save the food.

527
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,660
But that's when I almost got caught.

528
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,250
Hold up.

529
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,410
What was that sound?

530
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,210
Oh, no, I'm starving. This isn't good.

531
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,120
Why are you taking damage?

532
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,370
Are you starving?

533
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,170
Starving? Aha! No.

534
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:12,480
I'm just in pain because I love parkour so much 
and I wish I could do it all the time?

535
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,130
Oh man, sorry to hear that. Yeah, love hurts. 
Well, I hope you feel better.

536
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,800
By some miracle, the Parkour Pro bought my excuse.

537
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,320
If the Pro stayed around for any longer,
 I might have starved to death.

538
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,800
I had to eat the piece of beef that 
I just jumped for, but it didn't matter.

539
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,440
I had already prepared enough.

540
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,780
By rationing my food, I was able to save up 
four pieces of beef for the journey.

541
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,260
I had no clue whether this would be 
enough food to survive the trip,

542
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,750
but the old man said I had everything I needed,

543
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,090
so I guess I was just gonna have to trust him again.

544
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,720
Now, it was time to go searching for the ticket.

545
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,710
Crossing this line of stone means 
I'm heading into the parkour outskirts.

546
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,550
No Noob, including myself, has ever been out here.

547
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,430
And probably for a good reason.

548
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,880
All I know is that the further away 
you get from Parkour Civilization,

549
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,770
the more dangerous the jumps become.

550
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,170
Already, I was starting to see 
huge chunks of parkour missing.

551
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:00,180
No one knows how 
the outskirts came to be like this.
Already, I was starting to see 
huge chunks of parkour missing.

552
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,880
No one knows how 
the outskirts came to be like this.

553
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,920
Or at least no one down here knows.

554
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,580
Unfortunately, the compass kept taking me 
further and further away from Parkour Civilization.

555
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,450
The old man must have hid 
the ticket out here knowing that

556
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,580
no Parkour Pro would 
ever go this deep to retrieve it.

557
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,830
I was running out of time.

558
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,490
I had already been jumping for hours 
and now I'm down to one piece of raw beef left.

559
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,110
And still, I found nothing.

560
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,910
That was until I saw something in the distance.

561
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,020
I had no way of knowing, but I had a feeling that 
this was what I was looking for.

562
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,400
In all my time here in Parkour Civilization, 
I have never seen anything like this.

563
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,040
This couldn't be a coincidence,

564
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,950
which means I was gonna have to 
go parkour to the top.

565
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,390
I haven't really prepared for anything like this.

566
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,960
Vertical jumps don't exist naturally down here.

567
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,170
The only place I've seen vertical jumps 
is when I jump for food.

568
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,360
Luckily, I made it to the top without falling into the void.

569
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,690
I didn't see anything at first glance,
 but when I pulled out my compass,

570
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,020
I was in the right place.

571
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,220
I didn't get it. The compass was pointing me to 
the exact block I was standing on.

572
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,720
The ticket should be here,

573
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,760
unless the old man hid the ticket out of sight 
and put it underground.

574
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,020
If I broke this grass block 
and a Parkour Pro catches me,

575
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,160
I would for sure be going 
back to prison for life this time.

576
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,170
But if I'm gonna have any shot at 
making it up to the Parkour Pro civilization,

577
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,520
I'm gonna take that chance.

578
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,830
Well, here goes nothing.

579
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,680
I broke the block and underground, 
there was a chest.

580
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,250
I couldn't believe it. I had actually found the ticket.

581
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,610
But when I opened the chest, something was wrong.

582
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,310
There was no ticket to be found.

583
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,710
Just a barrier.

584
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,280
The old man lied to me.

585
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,020
There was no ticket to get up to the Pro civilization.

586
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,280
Why would he send me 
all the way out here to get a barrier block?

587
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,680
This didn't make any sense.

588
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,210
The old man knew I would 
risk my entire life for a ticket, but he set me up.

589
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,120
There had to be some explanation for this.

590
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,550
Well, if I'm lucky to survive the trip back,

591
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:51,430
I can ask him why he sent me 
all the way out here just to get a barrier block,

592
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,520
which is also illegal to have.

593
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,990
By some miracle, I made it back to 
the parkour checkpoint without falling.

594
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,780
Hey. You.

595
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,370
You were the last one to see the Pro stationed here.

596
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,480
What happened to him?

597
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,220
Oh, I, uh,

598
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:07,150
well I showed him a backwards jump 
and then he tried it for himself and then fell.

599
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,330
You? A backwards jump?

600
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,260
Are you serious?

601
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,610
Uh, yeah?

602
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,090
Okay, now I have to try.

603
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,470
So you just go backwards?

604
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:14,750
Oh!

605
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,280
Okay, and he's gone too.

606
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,620
Am I gonna be blamed for this?

607
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,280
Fortunately, I made it back to my house 
and no Parkour Pro has caught me

608
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,350
with the barrier block.

609
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,830
Now it's time to ask this old man why in the world 
he sent me out there to retrieve this.

610
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,870
All right bro, are you gonna explain to me why the—

611
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,880
What the...

612
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,460
When I got down to the basement,
 the old man was nowhere to be found.

613
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,770
All that was left was a hole in the ground.

614
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,380
Did he jump into the void on purpose?

615
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,280
I don't understand what's going on.

616
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,610
But that's when I paid attention to 
the item that was left on the ground.

617
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,070
I knew what it was before I even picked it up.

618
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,240
It was a ticket to rank up to become a Parkour Pro.

619
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,600
The old man had it on him the entire time 
but still sent me to retrieve the barrier block?

620
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,430
The old man wanted me to 
find this barrier for a reason.

621
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,750
And now this was the sign that I was 
ready to rank up to become a Parkour Pro.

622
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,250
It was time to head to the Parkour Temple.

623
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,920
I made my way back to the place that 
I never thought I'd step foot in again.

624
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,990
The place where no Parkour Noob in history 
has ever made it out alive.

625
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,160
I went ahead and ate my last piece of beef.

626
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,830
Just like last time, I was in such a perfect spot.

627
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,520
Three full bars of hunger is exactly what I need 
to make it to the top.

628
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,710
The barrier guarding the Temple was up, 
so I threw in my ticket

629
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,730
and the entrance to 
the Parkour Temple was now open.

630
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,560
All I had to do now was 
do something that I'd totally never do,

631
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,190
and that's fail one-block jumps.

632
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,810
Okay, I made the first jump. 
That's always a good sign.

633
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,380
This time around was different.

634
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,140
I wasn't gonna let the pressure get to me.

635
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,050
I was gonna be the first Noob 
to ever rank up to the Pro civilization.

636
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,210
Ah no, looking at this jump is giving me flashbacks.

637
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,650
<i>My journey to becoming a Parkour Pro starts no—</i>

638
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,960
No, this time was different.

639
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,540
I successfully made the first jump 
and for the first time in my life

640
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,960
I was actually on the parkour course.

641
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,870
Now all I had to do was just 
take it one jump at a time.

642
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,960
The first section was the stone blocks.

643
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,720
So far I've only encountered 
one-block vertical jumps,

644
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,310
but they were nothing I couldn't handle.

645
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,880
Even though I had been on the course 
for a good amount of time,

646
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,290
I was still ways away from making it to the top.

647
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,490
After I passed the stone block section, 
I moved on to the stone slab section.

648
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,660
Slabs aren't too common 
in the Noob level of Parkour Civilization,

649
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,710
but luckily this section wasn't too hard.

650
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,730
But it was the next section I was 
worried about, the stair jumps.

651
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,780
This next jump I had to complete 
was by far the hardest jump I've ever seen.

652
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,110
It was a two-block jump, 
but I had to go up half a block,

653
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,900
but I didn't come all this way to give up.

654
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,220
I went for the jump, but I jumped too early.

655
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,030
I thought this was it, but by some miracle, 
a block below me broke my fall,

656
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,210
and I only took two-and-a-half hearts of damage,

657
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,650
but that was too close to call.

658
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,650
If I was even the slightest bit off, 
I could have been all the way down there in the void.

659
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,840
On my second time around, I made the jump.

660
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,100
That stair jump essentially marked 
the end of the stair section,

661
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,190
and now I was on the stone walls.

662
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,450
Walls were almost never seen at 
the Noob level, but fortunately,

663
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,840
I didn't see anything bigger than 
a one-block jump for the rest of the way.

664
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,480
All I had to do was sneak and stay on the course,

665
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,050
and that's when I got to the point
 when the jumps stopped.

666
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,290
I was so high off the ground now,
 but I knew I was at the end.

667
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:12,940
I climbed up the stairs until I was 
face-to-face with the entrance

668
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,890
to the Parkour Pro civilization.

669
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,480
This was it. I was about to be 
the first Noob in history to rank up.

670
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,280
But then the realization hit me.

671
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,100
The last jump to get to the Parkour Pro civilization 
was a three-block jump.

672
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,700
It was impossible.

673
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,990
This was why no Noob has ever 
ranked up to become a Pro.

674
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,160
The course was impossible to begin with.

675
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,040
But then I remembered the barrier.

676
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,490
This is what the old man wanted me to use it for.

677
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,230
He knew the course was impossible 
and he wanted to give me a chance to rank up.

678
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,520
I placed down the barrier block 
and I made the two-block jump.

679
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,770
I did it. I actually did it.

680
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,160
I was the first Noob in history 
to ever complete this course.

681
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,180
No one at the bottom level knows 
what society is like up here.

682
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,540
And I was gonna be the first one to figure it out.

683
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,100
What was it gonna be like?

684
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,610
Was I actually gonna be able to see the sky?

685
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,100
Well, I guess we'll find out.

686
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,850
I walked up to the stone walls and the doors opened,

687
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:05,780
revealing a room I've never 
seen anything like before.

688
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,780
I turned the corner and I saw 
a Parkour Pro just standing there.

689
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,950
Uh, hi.

690
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,610
What the?

691
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,040
Who are you?

692
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,580
Where did you come from?

693
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,140
I'm the only one working here.

694
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,190
I came from the Noob level.

695
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,420
I just beat the course and ranked up.

696
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,930
Wow.

697
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,640
Um, I was not expecting this.

698
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,860
I'm not sure what to do here.

699
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,950
Uh, just go over there 
and throw your leather boots in the lava.

700
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,980
All right, time to get my iron boots.

701
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,640
Yes, sir. One ranked up.

702
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,140
A Noob by the name of Evbo.

703
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,120
Yes, sir. I'll keep an eye on him.

704
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,790
And that was it.

705
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,930
That was the last time I would ever 
wear leather boots again for the rest of my life.

706
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,770
From the looks of it, 
I only had one more lava jump to go.

707
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,500
But this time, there were dispensers.

708
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,400
I backed up and jumped over the lava,
 and I was equipped with iron boots.

709
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,650
I was officially a Parkour Pro.

710
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,020
After I went through, 
I saw one more jump that led to some barrels.

711
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,850
What is this for?

712
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,600
It's for food.

713
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,930
You only have to pay one jump for two steak here.

714
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,450
Only a one-block jump for food? That's amazing.

715
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,920
I opened the barrel 
to see something that I've never seen before.

716
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,120
Cooked meat?

717
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,510
In all of these!

718
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,550
In my entire life living on the Noob level, 
I've never seen a piece of cooked beef.

719
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,190
And now, as a Parkour Pro, 
I could fully replenish my hunger bar.

720
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,050
And that meant I could sprint now.

721
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,930
Oh, man, this is crazy!

722
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,480
Congratulations on becoming a Parkour Pro.

723
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,490
You can now head up those steps 
and begin your life in Parkour Pro civilization.

724
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,490
Those were the exact words I wanted to hear.

725
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,130
This is it.

726
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:31,110
When I walk up these steps, I will be at 
the top level of Parkour Civilization.

727
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,930
When I walked into the Temple, 
I immediately saw massive statues.

728
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:38,800
These statues looked like they were showing 
the Parkour Noobs and the Parkour Pros.

729
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,240
They even had their boots on.

730
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,550
This place is insane.

731
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,350
I've never seen anything like this.

732
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,270
I mean, look at these statue—

733
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,760
What the? Gold... boots?

734
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,950
Who wears gold boots?

735
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,170
This doesn't make any sense.

736
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,910
What is this?

737
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,240
Am I not at the top of Parkour Civilization?

738
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,180
Hey, parkour delivery.

739
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,820
Let's go! My parkour delivery is here.

740
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,690
Now that I'm a Parkour Pro,
 I can get parkour delivered to my house.

741
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,370
Hey, did you order 
parkour construction to this house?

742
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,120
Yes, sir, that's me.

743
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,350
I ordered the, uh, 
six-block tall slime jump to my bedroom.

744
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,240
Sounds good.

745
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,210
Where do you want it built?

746
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,590
Ah, let's see.

747
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,080
I think this would be a good place for it.

748
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,270
You think you can build it right there?

749
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,940
Oh, sure. I can make that happen.

750
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,680
To think just a few days ago I was a Parkour Noob,

751
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,060
and now I'm getting custom parkour jumps 
installed in my house is crazy.

752
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,900
This look good?

753
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,310
Yep, I think it's perfect.

754
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,550
Hey, thanks man, 
for parkouring all the way out here.

755
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,820
Sure, you got my payment?

756
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,010
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

757
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,850
It was four one-blocks in a row, right?

758
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay, one, two, three, four.

759
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,390
There you go. Thank you very much.

760
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,380
And my tip?

761
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,260
Your tip?

762
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,920
Really?

763
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,610
Don't tell me you thought you weren't gonna tip me.

764
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,410
If you're a Parkour Pro, it's always expected 
that you tip when you buy something.

765
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,520
Oh, I hope I make this.

766
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,510
Oh, that was close.

767
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,100
Oh, wow. A 360?

768
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,590
Yeah, you're good, man. Thanks.

769
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:58,820
And like most things in Parkour Civilization, 
the way you tip is with more parkour.

770
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,050
Luckily, I survived that payment 
for the jump installed in my house.

771
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,960
If I missed any one of those jumps,

772
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,560
I would have fallen back down 
to the Parkour Noob level

773
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,230
and my journey to become a Pro 
would have been for nothing.

774
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,760
But I won't say it wasn't worth it 
because now I can practice slime jumps

775
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,750
anytime I want inside of my house.

776
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,680
And this is how my new life is 
as a Pro in Parkour Civilization.

777
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,110
No Parkour Noob at the bottom level 
knows what life is like up here,

778
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,270
except I was the only one to rank up 
and become a part of parkour society.

779
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,780
To rank up to a Parkour Pro, 
I had to be the first Noob in history

780
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,040
to beat an impossible parkour course.

781
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,670
When I got to the top, I got my iron boots and I was officially a Pro.

782
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,890
I thought I had made it.

783
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,430
I thought I was at the top of Parkour Civilization.

784
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,200
But that's when I realized I truly knew nothing 
about the world I was living in.

785
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,090
My journey to getting to the top of Parkour Civilization

786
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,780
wasn't even close to being done.

787
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,670
Now I was about to discover what life was like 
on the second layer of Parkour Civilization.

788
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,240
At the Parkour Pro level 
everywhere you look is a two-block jump.

789
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,520
When I was a Parkour Noob 
I thought two-block jumps were extremely hard.

790
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,680
But now that I could sprint, 
I realized they were almost like one-block jumps.

791
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,220
Something about the Pro level felt different.

792
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,390
Maybe it was the fact that when I was a Noob,
 I would see dirt in the sky,

793
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,910
but now there's nothing above me.

794
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,370
And that's when I looked back 
at the Parkour Temple.

795
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,820
There was still a world above me,
 and now it was way higher up.

796
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,580
But there was something else that was different.

797
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,220
I was staring down at the house I used to live in.

798
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,920
When I was down on the Noob level, 
I would look up and all I would see is dirt,

799
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,430
but somehow on the Pro level I could look down,
 and I could only assume that

800
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,210
the same goes for the layer above me.

801
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,810
Now that I was adjusted to 
my surroundings, it was time to go

802
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,560
searching for a place to buy a house.

803
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,370
That was assuming that 
life still worked like that up here.

804
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:39,790
When I took a look around, all I saw were 
the same identical buildings.

805
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,950
Maybe this time I wouldn't be getting a mansion.

806
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,300
But that's when I found 
a building that looked different

807
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,260
and it definitely didn't look like a house.

808
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,920
When I walked inside the building,
 sure enough, it was a shop to buy a new house.

809
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,890
Hey, aren't you the Noob who ranked up?

810
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,780
That would be me.

811
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,040
Oh yeah, I thought it was you.

812
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,270
I'm selling houses today.

813
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,330
Choose one you wanna buy.

814
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,640
Let's go, it's time to buy 
my first house as a Parkour Pro.

815
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,970
Let's see what these prices are.

816
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,160
I can get one house for a two-block jump.

817
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,310
Oh, that's super cheap!

818
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,640
All right, what is this one over here?

819
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,260
I can get one house for a 2.5 block jump.

820
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,960
Okay, that's a little more expensive.

821
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,460
And this last one is one house for a three-blo—

822
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,040
Wait, why are these all the same?

823
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,080
All of these options are for the same house.

824
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,820
Oops, busted. Hehe.

825
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,660
I was trying to get a little more profit.

826
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,210
Why would anyone fall for that?

827
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,760
Since there was only one house to buy,

828
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,950
I obviously went with the cheapest option 
and bought my first house

829
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,250
with a two-block jump.

830
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,990
Congrats on buying your first house
 as a Parkour Pro.

831
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:31,940
Let me take you to it.

832
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,950
Let's go!

833
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,550
Since all the houses were identical,

834
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,150
it was no surprise that I got one that looked like this.

835
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,610
Uh, you're all set to move in.

836
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:42,050
Feel free to call the Parkour Delivery Service 
if you want your jumps changed.

837
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,800
A Parkour Delivery Service?

838
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,470
Let's go!

839
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,950
Being a Parkour Pro is awesome.

840
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,560
The living room in my house 
had two one-block jumps,

841
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,410
and the entire house itself was three stories tall.

842
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:54,250
Looks like three jumps to 
get to my bed on the top floor.

843
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,760
Hey, it's your neighbor.

844
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,510
Can I come in?

845
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,010
Oh, uh, sure.

846
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:58,790
Thanks.

847
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,670
You're that Evbo guy, right?

848
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,170
You're the Noob who 
beat the course and ranked up?

849
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,460
Uh, yeah, that's me.

850
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,540
I'm the first one to do it, I guess.

851
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,250
I can't believe you're my neighbor.

852
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,230
That's crazy.

853
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,880
Well, you probably have 
questions about life up here, right?

854
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,080
Anything you wanna know?

855
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,480
Uh, yeah, one actually.

856
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,330
Uh, what happens when we fall?

857
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,140
What is the punishment for 
missing a jump at the Pro level?

858
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,250
You go down a level.

859
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,290
If you miss a jump, you'll be a Noob,

860
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,140
and you'll have to beat the course again.

861
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,090
Okay, so I can never fall, noted.

862
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,610
So who are the people above us then?

863
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,010
What's above a Pro?

864
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,110
It's probably best I just show you.

865
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,320
Here, come with me.

866
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,670
My neighbors started telling me

867
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,490
everything there was 
to know about Parkour Civilization.

868
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,900
He brought me back to the Parkour Temple 
where all the statues were.

869
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,190
He explained how 
Parkour Civilization starts at the Noob level,

870
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,580
and at level two, you become a Parkour Pro.

871
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,830
Then, there were the Parkour Masters.

872
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,510
If you were lucky enough to rank up,

873
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,150
you get gold boots, and you become a Master.

874
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,570
My neighbor said that Parkour Masters 
never come down to the Pro level.

875
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,680
But if they do ever come down, 
it's a Parkour Pro's nightmare.

876
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,160
He said the Parkour Masters are ruthless.

877
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,590
And then he walked over to the largest statue,
 the one with the diamond boots.

878
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,470
He said that this was the Parkour Champion.

879
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:13,240
He said that most people down here 
don't even believe that the Champion is real.

880
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,430
But the stories say there can only be 
one Parkour Champion.

881
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:20,100
Whoever that was lives at 
the top of Parkour Civilization,

882
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,980
which means if I was gonna make it to the top,

883
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,250
I would have to become a Parkour Champion.

884
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,580
My first day as a Parkour Pro was strange.

885
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,730
For once, no one was at my door 
making me parkour for food.

886
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,760
But then the question was, how do I get food now?

887
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,910
Or what do I even do?

888
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,660
I saw that there was another Pro 
going somewhere, so I decided to follow him.

889
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,660
Soon after, I saw another Pro 
going in the same direction,

890
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,520
which meant they were probably 
heading to something important.

891
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,620
After jumping for a few minutes, 
I saw what they were heading to.

892
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,810
They were all heading to this 
massive structure in the distance.

893
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,150
When I got closer, I saw that there was 
a bunch of Parkour Pros lined up for something.

894
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,320
Whatever this place was,

895
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,300
these Parkour Pros were willing to do 
two-block vertical jumps to get here.

896
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,090
Fortunately, I didn't fail any of these jumps,
 and I made it into the line.

897
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:06,640
I must have woken up late to whatever this was,
 because I was the last one to show up.

898
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,470
At this point, I didn't know if 
that was a good thing or a bad thing,

899
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:12,350
but that's when I saw what 
everyone was waiting in line for.

900
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,770
There was a dispenser at the end of the structure.

901
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:18,580
The Pro in front of me picked up two items,
 but the only thing I saw them holding

902
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,680
was a piece of paper.

903
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,190
What could be so valuable about that piece of paper

904
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,210
that people would wait in line this long for?

905
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,400
When it was my turn, I clicked the button 
and I got a piece of steak.

906
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,850
So this is how the Parkour Pros get food.

907
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,950
Then I received the piece of paper.

908
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,660
The paper said farm work equals 15 minutes.

909
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,410
And this is when I realized how life was 
different on the Pro level of Parkour Civilization.

910
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:43,760
Instead of parkouring for food like the Noobs do,
 the Pros parkour for work,

911
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,510
just like the guy who sold me my house, 
the guards in Parkour Prison,

912
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,880
or even the Pros that fed me every day.

913
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,820
They were all just completing their daily task 
that they got from this piece of paper.

914
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,820
And now for my first daily task, 
I was assigned to work on the farm.

915
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,260
Before this, I had never seen 
an animal in Parkour Civilization,

916
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,270
but this is the place they were all kept.

917
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,720
This place was responsible for 
feeding all of the Parkour Pros

918
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,250
and all of the Parkour Noobs.

919
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,100
And it should be no surprise that 
in Parkour Civilization,

920
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,710
even the animals had to do a parkour course.

921
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,970
My daily task meant that I had to 
watch all of the animals that did the parkour course.

922
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,670
Oh man, this job is terrible.

923
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,180
Now I'm just gonna have to watch
 a cow fall off and di—

924
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,260
Whoa, what the?

925
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,290
Oh my god, this cow is cookin'

926
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,320
How did it even do that?

927
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,680
The Parkour Pros only eat the meat from 
the animals that complete the parkour course.

928
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,090
They say it enhances your parkour abilities.

929
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,120
As for the other animals that 
don't make the course, well,

930
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,400
that's where the meat comes from 
on the Noob level.

931
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,390
And some Noob's gonna have to eat that.

932
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,250
Wow, I cannot say I miss that.

933
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,940
Parkour Pros do their daily tasks for a reason.

934
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,920
Once you've completed the task that
 you got on your piece of paper,

935
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,970
you take it to the training grounds.

936
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:54,280
This place is basically the only reason
 Parkour Pros are incentivized to work.

937
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,560
This is because this is 
the only place in Parkour Civilization

938
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,510
where you can practice parkour without
 worrying about falling to the lower level.

939
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,440
The entrance to the training grounds 
is blocked by a barrier,

940
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,500
and the only way in is to throw in 
your slip of paper once you've completed the work.

941
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,290
The daily task I completed gave me 
15 minutes of practice time.

942
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:17,210
That meant for the next 15 minutes I could 
practice any parkour jump I could possibly think of.

943
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:20,350
Here, you have the ability 
to build any parkour jump you want.

944
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,890
But with this being my first day as a Parkour Pro,

945
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,880
I didn't even know what I needed to practice,

946
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,660
so I just decided to do 
the jumps that people left here.

947
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,640
It seemed like a lot of the Pros were 
practicing fence jumps,

948
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,140
which are jumps I had little to no experience on,

949
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,840
but what scared me the most 
is what I saw over here.

950
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,450
Someone was practicing not one, 
but multiple three-block vertical jumps.

951
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,020
It almost seemed impossible to do even one.

952
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,040
But if someone was practicing these jumps,

953
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,430
that could only mean one thing.

954
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:50,360
That the way up to become a Parkour Master 
would be nearly impossible.

955
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,560
If I was gonna have any shot 
at ranking up to become a Master,

956
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,550
I was gonna have to spend 
much more time in here practicing.

957
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:01,120
Ah, another beautiful day and I don't have to 
wake up to either raw chicken or raw beef.

958
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,290
Even though I've only been here for a few days, 
I feel like I haven't really enjoyed myself yet.

959
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,820
I mean, for once in my life, I don't even have 
to go outside to parkour for food.

960
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,730
I don't even have to grab my piece of steak.

961
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,550
I'll still have full hunger for days.

962
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,660
And now, instead of being bullied by all the Parkour Pros

963
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,240
like I was down at the Noob level,

964
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,230
I can just do anything I want 
and no one's here to punish me.

965
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,940
Hey, you wanna come with me to get our daily jobs?

966
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,980
I don't wanna be late.

967
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,200
Uh, yeah, I don't think I'm gonna do my daily task.

968
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,150
I think I'm just gonna chill today, honestly.

969
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,160
What?

970
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,930
What do you mean you're gonna chill?

971
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,450
You're not gonna get your daily task?

972
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,640
Are you sure about that?

973
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,450
What? I mean, no one says we have to,
 so what's the problem?

974
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,140
I don't know.

975
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,670
I just have never seen anyone not do their daily task.

976
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,880
Wow, maybe I'm teaching the Parkour Pros that 
they don't have to parkour all the time.

977
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,090
But later that day, I realized I made a huge mistake.

978
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,330
Uh, what in the world is that sound?

979
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,300
Bro, come on, I was just trying to sleep.

980
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,140
Who keeps making that horn noise?

981
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,140
Dude, hurry!

982
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,470
You gotta get out here now.

983
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,560
Follow me and make sure you don't miss a jump.

984
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?

985
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,010
Be late for what?

986
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,180
Wait, where are you going?

987
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,090
I started parkouring in the direction that
 my neighbor was going.

988
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:16,030
And that's when I saw a bunch of Parkour Pros 
lined up standing completely still.

989
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,000
I had no clue what was going on, 
but I followed my neighbor

990
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,230
and soon I got in line 
with all of the other Parkour Pros.

991
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,800
No one was saying anything.

992
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,610
Hey, can anyone tell me what's going on?

993
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:28,430
Dude, don't say anything and look straight ahead.

994
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,890
Why? Can't someone just explain what's happening?

995
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,150
But that's when it happened.

996
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,010
Not too far ahead, 
someone dropped down from the sky.

997
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,010
It was a Parkour Master.

998
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,850
One of you was supposed to design a new course,

999
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,980
but someone didn't do their task.

1000
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,630
Who was it?

1001
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,890
Oh no, I'm done for.

1002
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,480
Why does this have to be me?

1003
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,870
I watched as the Parkour Master interrogated 
each and every one of the Parkour Pros,

1004
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,860
knowing that sooner or later, 
he was gonna show up where I was.

1005
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,420
You.

1006
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,410
What was your task?

1007
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,960
My task, I, uh,

1008
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,050
I was selling houses to Noobs on the bottom level.

1009
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,860
Ha, ha, ha, someone already did that task.

1010
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,720
Prepare for a parkour battle.

1011
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,450
A parkour battle?

1012
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,740
The parkour battle starts now.

1013
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,750
This is just great.

1014
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:14,470
Why does my first parkour battle 
have to be against a Parkour Master?

1015
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:18,290
For my first attack I'm attacking you 
with a three-block jump.

1016
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,490
Okay a three-block jump, that's doable.

1017
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,100
I think I can survive this round.

1018
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,660
In Parkour Civilization it should be no surprise

1019
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,860
that people fight each other with more parkour.

1020
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,680
If someone attacks you with a jump 
and you don't make it, you pay the price.

1021
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,720
Oh, this isn't good.

1022
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,150
I'm already down four hearts.

1023
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,860
Ha ha ha, I gave you an easy one, but I guess 
this is gonna be over faster than I thought.

1024
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,660
Get ready for my next attack.

1025
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,130
The worst part about parkour battles 
is you can't even attack your opponent

1026
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,280
until you defend one of their attacks.

1027
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,940
And by the looks of this next jump,

1028
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,870
I probably won't be attacking
 the Parkour Master at all.

1029
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,620
Your turn.

1030
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,950
Four-blocks by three-blocks diagonal jump.

1031
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,380
All right, here goes nothing.

1032
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,950
One, two, three, four,

1033
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,230
one, two, three.

1034
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,760
Oh man, this is so far!

1035
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,290
How did he do this first try?

1036
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,320
I was hoping I would get lucky, 
but luck wasn't on my side.

1037
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,110
The second attack hit me 
and I was down to two hearts.

1038
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,420
Ha ha, this is too fun for me.

1039
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,840
One more attack and you'll be gone forever.

1040
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,170
The Parkour Master was right.

1041
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,520
If I fail to defend one more attack,
 it's game over for me.

1042
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,050
All I could hope for now is that 
the Parkour Master fails this last jump.

1043
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:21,580
That way I could actually have a chance to attack.

1044
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,410
No way he makes this first try—

1045
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,560
Oh god, he made it.

1046
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,630
This is it for you, Parkour Pro.

1047
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:29,370
A three-block vertical jump to decide your fate.

1048
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:30,090
This was it.

1049
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,920
My entire journey in Parkour Civilization 
came down to this one jump,

1050
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,880
and it was a three-block vertical jump.

1051
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,570
I thought when I ranked up 
to become a Parkour Pro,

1052
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:41,090
my days of parkouring to survive were over,

1053
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:44,380
but I soon realized I knew 
nothing about parkour society.

1054
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:48,470
Even as a Pro, I wasn't even close 
to being at the top of Parkour Civilization.

1055
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,070
The Parkour Pros were the workers of society.

1056
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,800
Every day, we would get a new daily job to complete,

1057
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,730
and I found out the hard way 
what happens if you skip your job,

1058
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:00,720
because the one day I didn't get my daily task, 
a Parkour Master came down

1059
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,520
and challenged me to a parkour battle.

1060
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,890
And now I have to do the hardest jump 
I've ever done in my life if I wanna live.

1061
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:07,720
This was it.

1062
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,500
All my work to rank up to become a Parkour Pro

1063
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,860
was gonna be for nothing if I didn't make this jump.

1064
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,910
But at least I was gonna die trying.

1065
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,940
I took a deep breath and I jumped.

1066
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,850
What?

1067
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,410
Is... is this real?

1068
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,590
I... I did it.

1069
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,680
I made a three-block vertical jump.

1070
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,880
Haha, you just bought yourself 
five more minutes of time,

1071
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,420
but we both know your fate.

1072
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,840
Get ready to attack me.

1073
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,260
The Parkour Master was right.

1074
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,340
All I did was buy myself a little time.

1075
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,170
How was I gonna be able to do a jump 
that the Parkour Master couldn't do?

1076
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,800
And if I make it too easy, the Parkour Master will just

1077
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,350
get another chance to attack me.

1078
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:44,710
I got lucky last time, but I don't think I'd survive 
another attack from the Parkour Master.

1079
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:48,810
For my first attack, I built 
a one-block jump and I did a 360.

1080
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,610
Maybe, just maybe, there was 
a chance this would work.

1081
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,170
Wow, a 360?

1082
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,450
I've never done that before,
 but if you did it, it can't be that hard.

1083
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,290
Let's go! He's never done it before.

1084
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,940
I needed him to fail this jump.

1085
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,180
What? How?

1086
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,670
Who even does 360s? What is this?

1087
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:07,520
By some miracle, my attack 
against the Parkour Master was successful.

1088
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,080
I think I found his weakness.

1089
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,680
He couldn't do a 360. This was my chance.

1090
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,280
I just had to make sure that I kept making my jumps.

1091
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,740
For my next attack, I built a two-block jump.

1092
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,400
I've never even made this jump before,
 but my entire life depended on it.

1093
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,620
I jumped and I successfully made 
a two-block jump with a 360.

1094
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,750
This is ridiculous. How are you doing these jumps?

1095
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:32,080
I watched as the Parkour Master tried 
to defend against my attack, but once again,

1096
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,290
the 360 was too difficult for him.

1097
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,880
This can't be possible. How are you beating me?

1098
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,930
Now, both the Parkour Master and I
 were at two hearts.

1099
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,140
The next person to land an attack 
would win the parkour battle.

1100
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,070
Alright, you ready for 
a three-block jump with a 360?

1101
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,980
No, stop. I yield!

1102
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,420
You win the parkour battle.

1103
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,800
What? Are you serious?

1104
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,620
No way, I actually won the parkour battle?

1105
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,470
Somehow I beat a Parkour Master.

1106
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:59,770
Because you beat me, I have 
something that can help you rank up

1107
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,500
to become a Parkour Master.

1108
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,570
I could become a Parkour Master?

1109
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,740
The Master said that the course to 
becoming a Parkour Master would be impossible,

1110
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,140
but he had something that could 
help me along the way.

1111
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,410
He pulled out an item and threw it on the ground.

1112
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,380
I went to pick it up and I figured out that 
it was a Totem of Undying.

1113
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,750
He said somewhere in the course 
there is a jump that I won't survive,

1114
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,970
and I'll know it when I see it.

1115
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,570
He told me to go attempt the course 
to rank up and find this jump.

1116
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,960
He said to find any information about 
the secret to completing that jump,

1117
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,280
because if I can figure out how to make the jump,

1118
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,040
I could rank up to become a Parkour Master.

1119
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,990
This was insane.

1120
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:38,110
Earlier today, I didn't even know parkour battles existed,

1121
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,100
and somehow I won my first battle,

1122
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,910
not just against anyone, but a Parkour Master.

1123
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,460
And now I actually have a reason 
to go back to the Parkour Temple

1124
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,230
and try to do the course 
to become a Parkour Master.

1125
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:52,730
I didn't like thinking about the fact that 
that wasn't the course to rank up.

1126
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,200
That was just the path to get up to the Temple.

1127
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,170
But I wasn't gonna make the journey 
up the Temple just yet.

1128
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:02,510
Not only did I need food to get my health back,
 but I needed to do my daily task.

1129
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,560
I barely escaped with my life 
after missing one day of work,

1130
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,200
so I wasn't gonna do that again.

1131
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,980
And today, my task was "Feed Noobs."

1132
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,730
I realized after all this time of being a Parkour Pro,

1133
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,510
I've never made my way back down 
to the Noob level yet.

1134
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,280
I wonder if anything's changed down there 
since I ranked up.

1135
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,040
If you're a Pro in Parkour Civilization and you fall,

1136
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,980
you'll lose your rank and become a Noob again.

1137
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,460
But you can still go down to the lower level.

1138
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,630
There's just a different way.

1139
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:30,940
This is the first time I had been back to 
this part of the Parkour Temple since I ranked up.

1140
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:35,170
And now that I was a Pro, I had access to 
a different doorway that I've never seen before.

1141
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,950
This new path led to a giant staircase 
that would take me back down to the Noob level.

1142
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:42,320
If I missed one of these jumps, I would for sure die.

1143
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,370
But fortunately, one-block jumps are too easy for me 
now that I'm a Parkour Pro.

1144
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:49,680
When I got to the bottom, I collected 
everything I needed in order for me

1145
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,120
to complete my daily task.

1146
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,380
It's crazy to think that I'm still 
the only one to have ever completed this course.

1147
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,790
But the barrier I used still should be there,
 so maybe someone else will.

1148
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:00,030
This is so strange.

1149
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:01,690
I once lived in this neighborhood.

1150
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,110
That was once my mansion.

1151
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:07,080
And now, as a Parkour Pro, I can see 
what it really looks like from down here.

1152
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,970
When I lived here, I was the only one that

1153
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,500
lived in my neighborhood, 
or at least the only one left.

1154
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,100
So does anyone live here anymore?

1155
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,560
Hello? Anyone home?

1156
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,310
Okay, I guess not.

1157
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,110
Maybe someone bought my mansion?

1158
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:18,750
I don't know.

1159
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,290
Uh, hello? Anyone here?

1160
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:21,760
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

1161
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,630
Oh, no way. Someone actually does live here.

1162
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:25,330
All right, time to set up the jumps.

1163
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,900
Let's see, one-block jump for raw chicken and then

1164
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,210
the one block vertical jump for raw beef.

1165
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,570
Man, I can't believe I'm actually doing this job now.

1166
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,170
All right, mandatory parkour check.

1167
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:35,080
Oh, great.

1168
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:35,820
It's you.

1169
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,350
You're a Parkour Noob now?

1170
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:38,670
Weren't you just at my house?

1171
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,380
Yeah, you delivered my parkour to me.

1172
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,680
So, what happened?

1173
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,500
What do you think happened, genius?

1174
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,630
You just paid me a huge tip and I was <i>so</i> happy.

1175
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,210
And then I fell out the front door.

1176
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:51,090
Hey man, well, you know, I ranked up so you could too.

1177
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,020
Alright, so now you have to choose your jump.

1178
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,550
You think I don't know what to do already?

1179
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,760
Just let me jump for my food in peace.

1180
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,710
Hey, I feel like I remember being in a situation that was just like this.

1181
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,360
<i>You really think I could rank up to be a Parkour Pro?</i>

1182
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,790
<i>Ha! Not a chance.</i>

1183
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,080
<i>You're a Parkour Noob.</i>

1184
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,890
And you think you're <i>soooo</i> good now.

1185
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,260
Just wait 'till I rank up.

1186
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,930
Oh, shoot.

1187
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,220
Oh man, that sucks.

1188
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,310
Dang, now he has to spend another 
50 years in Parkour Prison.

1189
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:15,850
Oh well.

1190
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,870
After only finding two Noobs to feed,

1191
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:20,810
I went back to the other neighborhood 
where I found the old man.

1192
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:23,810
It just seemed so weird that 
he disappeared out of nowhere.

1193
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:26,330
I wanted to see if there's 
a chance that he came back.

1194
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:30,170
But when I got to the house, 
a Parkour Master walked out the front door.

1195
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,820
Luckily, I wasn't spotted.

1196
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:35,190
What was a Parkour Master doing 
all the way at the Noob level?

1197
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,280
And why did he come from this house?

1198
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,760
When I thought the coast was clear, 
I made my way over.

1199
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,050
This couldn't be a coincidence.

1200
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,920
This is the only house I've seen with a secret room

1201
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,190
and now a Parkour Master shows up here?

1202
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:48,480
Does the Master even know about the secret room?

1203
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,850
I went to go inside, but something was wrong.

1204
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:54,170
There was no secret doorway. It was gone!

1205
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:56,170
I was sure this was the right house.

1206
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:59,680
That Parkour Master must have 
came here to block up the entrance.

1207
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,850
I sat there thinking about why 
the Parkour Master would do that.

1208
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,450
But nothing made sense to me.

1209
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,120
But that didn't matter to me right now.

1210
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,670
Now that I finished my daily task, it was time to

1211
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,280
try the course to rank up to become 
a Parkour Master and find this impossible jump.

1212
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,830
I got back up to the Pro level, 
dropped off my daily task paper,

1213
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:19,360
and got ready to climb the Parkour Temple.

1214
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,890
Now I had one thing to worry about, and that was

1215
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:24,570
making this initial course to get into the Temple.

1216
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:25,950
I wasn't worried about falling.

1217
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:28,570
I was worried about wasting my Totem of Undying.

1218
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:32,000
The Parkour Master said that 
I would not survive the impossible jump.

1219
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,040
So if I got to that jump with no Totem of Undying,

1220
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,210
then this entire journey would be for nothing.

1221
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:41,940
I scaled my way up the side 
of the Parkour Temple until I got to the very top.

1222
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,450
Most of the jumps were two-block vertical jumps,

1223
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,490
but towards the end 
I had to make this three-block jump.

1224
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:49,940
Now, I couldn't afford to make any mistakes.

1225
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,880
That's when I made the last jump,
 and I was inside the Parkour Temple.

1226
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,980
What's crazy is that none of those jumps 
were a part of the real course to rank up.

1227
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,710
This was the real course.

1228
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:04,420
Already, at first glance, I was seeing 
blocks I've never seen used in parkour before,

1229
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,730
but I was expecting that.

1230
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:09,130
There's a reason why almost 
no Pros even attempt this course,

1231
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,970
and that's because it's so dangerous.

1232
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:14,170
Fence jumps, trapdoor jumps, and ladder jumps?

1233
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:17,130
The jumps just kept getting 
harder and harder the more I looked at it.

1234
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,580
But I wasn't here to rank up.

1235
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:23,200
All I was here to do was find the impossible jump 
that the Parkour Master told me about.

1236
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,250
If I find this jump and study it like he told me to,

1237
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,460
maybe I have an actual chance of 
becoming a Parkour Master.

1238
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:33,630
I climbed to the top of the ladder, 
and now I was really at the start of the course.

1239
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,090
Any fall from this height would result in death.

1240
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:39,500
And of course I have to do 
fence jumps as the very first section.

1241
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,080
I held out my Totem of Undying, 
and I climbed on the course to begin.

1242
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,810
Fence jumps were my worst nightmare,
 but so far I've made three in a row.

1243
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:49,540
But I soon realized that that's all I needed to do,

1244
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,250
because I think I found the impossible jump.

1245
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,750
What is this jump?

1246
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,250
Is this a four-block vertical fence jump?

1247
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,080
There's no way this is the right way, right?

1248
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,710
But there was nowhere else to go.

1249
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:04,150
This was clearly the right path,
 but this jump was, it had to be impossible.

1250
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:06,480
Well, the Master gave me a totem for a reason.

1251
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,740
I attempted the jump, but got 
nowhere close to even making it.

1252
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,350
That was it.

1253
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:12,960
That was my one chance 
to use the Totem of Undying,

1254
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,630
and I'm just hoping that 
that was the jump he was talking about.

1255
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:19,440
Now, I had to study the jump,
 and I knew just the way to do that.

1256
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,320
Fortunately, it was my neighbor who was 
working as the Parkour Delivery Service today.

1257
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,030
Hey, I need a jump built in my house.

1258
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:25,440
Follow me.

1259
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,690
I need to show you what it looks like.

1260
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,440
All right, so for the jump I need built,

1261
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,340
it's kind of a little ways away.

1262
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:33,850
Oh, man, is the parkour jump all the way up there?

1263
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,180
Uh, yeah, it's fine.

1264
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,000
I'll tip you good.

1265
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,610
Just follow me.

1266
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:39,350
I brought my neighbor 
all the way up into the Parkour Temple

1267
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,340
and showed him the jump I wanted him to build.

1268
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,980
Since the jump was complicated,

1269
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:46,480
he placed down a block that 
copies every block on this jump.

1270
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,210
And after paying for his services,

1271
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:51,980
I now have this impossible parkour jump 
inside my own house.

1272
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,650
Now I can study this jump every single day.

1273
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,860
It turns out the jump was 
a three-block vertical jump,

1274
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,750
but with the fences it turns into a four-block.

1275
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,500
It was actually impossible.

1276
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,900
So what was I missing here?

1277
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:07,630
I couldn't just practice this jump 
because Parkour Civilization laws state

1278
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:10,580
all jumps inside your home must have a risk of dying.

1279
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,520
So practicing wasn't gonna be my best option.

1280
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,940
Ah, this doesn't make any sense.

1281
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,420
I'll think about it tomorrow, I guess.

1282
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,770
I was gonna leave it, but that's when I slipped.

1283
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:19,280
No!

1284
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,270
For my entire life, I've been parkouring to survive.

1285
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:24,920
That's how any of us survive in Parkour Civilization.

1286
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,200
If you don't make the jumps, you pay the price.

1287
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,340
But no matter how many people I've seen fall,

1288
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,080
that never stopped me from 
believing that I could parkour

1289
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,810
all the way to the top of society.

1290
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,120
I was the first Noob to ever 
rank up to become a Parkour Pro.

1291
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,010
I beat a Parkour Master in my first parkour battle,

1292
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:42,080
and I even found the impossible jump that

1293
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,020
the Parkour Master told me to look for.

1294
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,190
The worst part is, is I was so close.

1295
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:48,280
I actually thought I could be a Champion one day.

1296
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,320
But one jump can change everything.

1297
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:50,720
No!

1298
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,260
I thought I was dead until I wasn't.

1299
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:53,840
What?

1300
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,250
How am I alive?

1301
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,090
My journey in Parkour Civilization 
should have ended.

1302
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:01,790
I was supposed to die there, 
but a barrier block caught my fall.

1303
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,760
This barrier block had to have been 
placed by someone, right?

1304
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,320
Unless it wasn't.

1305
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,830
The guy who came to deliver parkour 
used a device that copied

1306
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,250
every single block from the impossible jump.

1307
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,520
That had to be it.

1308
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,930
The barrier was from the impossible jump.

1309
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:18,720
This is what the Parkour Master wanted me to find.

1310
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,340
It was the way to get past the impossible jump.

1311
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:26,140
And now that I know about it, I can actually 
rank up to become a Parkour Master.

1312
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,160
This means I was gonna have to prepare.

1313
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,130
I couldn't believe it.

1314
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:32,890
Just a few minutes ago, I was about to 
fall down back to the Noob level

1315
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,990
and become a Parkour Noob forever.

1316
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:39,180
And now I'm preparing to rank up again 
to become a Parkour Master.

1317
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,640
All right, let's see what my daily task is today.

1318
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,960
"Parkour course building."

1319
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,700
Okay? Definitely can <i>not</i> skip that.

1320
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,890
The last time I tried skipping my daily task,

1321
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,690
I was assigned parkour course building,

1322
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:52,570
and that resulted in a Parkour Master 
challenging me to a parkour battle

1323
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:55,280
where I barely survived, 
so I'm not gonna do that again.

1324
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,880
So far, this was the first time I've done a daily task 
that was located in Parkour Prison.

1325
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,400
And the only way to get there 
is by jumping in the void.

1326
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,200
Ever since I escaped this prison, 
I've never been back, and now I'm working here.

1327
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,630
Oh, finally you're here.

1328
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,120
I thought you were never gonna show up.

1329
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,900
The Parkour Masters want 
another glass course made.

1330
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,980
And make sure you don't make the jumps too easy.

1331
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,140
There's only two Noobs left in Parkour Prison,

1332
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,000
so I'll just grab one of them to do the course.

1333
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,060
There's only two Noobs left in Parkour Prison?

1334
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,790
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

1335
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:24,900
In Parkour Civilization, 
the Parkour Pros are responsible

1336
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,980
for building new parkour courses 
for the Parkour Masters.

1337
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,980
And since the Pros would never wanna 
try these courses on their own,

1338
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,560
the prisoners of Parkour Prison are used instead.

1339
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,030
No way, it's you again!

1340
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,880
<i>And you think you're </i>soooo<i> good now.</i>

1341
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,320
<i>Just wait 'till I rank up.</i>

1342
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,920
<i>Oh, shoot!</i>

1343
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,190
I'm sorry, man, but you got to be 
the one to do random parkour testing today.

1344
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:44,530
Why can't you pick the old guy?

1345
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:45,840
He's like a hundred years old.

1346
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,280
Look, man, I don't make the rules.

1347
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,480
You just got to do the course.

1348
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,660
This is <i>too</i> easy.

1349
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,890
I'm making it out of here.

1350
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:51,280
No, no.

1351
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,360
Oh, no, he's gone for real this time.

1352
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,860
All right, daily task completed.

1353
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,740
One step closer to becoming a Parkour Master.

1354
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,020
May you save us all, Evbo.

1355
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,650
After a few more days of 
completing more daily tasks,

1356
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,720
I was getting closer to attempting the course 
to rank up to become a Master.

1357
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,600
I had been planning this out carefully.

1358
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,750
I wasn't just gonna go into 
the hardest parkour course of my life unprepared.

1359
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:17,350
I had saved four of my daily task papers 
to take to the Parkour Training Grounds.

1360
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:22,090
As a Parkour Pro, each daily task you complete 
gives you 15 minutes of practice time.

1361
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:26,520
Since I saved up, I have now one hour 
to practice as much parkour as I could.

1362
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,650
This would probably be one of 
the last times I could parkour

1363
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,210
without worrying about dying.

1364
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:34,980
Because once I step foot into the Parkour Temple 
to become a Master,

1365
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,430
there would be no turning back.

1366
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,960
All of this preparation is relying on the fact that

1367
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,030
there actually is a secret path 
to get past the impossible jump.

1368
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:45,210
But I've come too far and I've been through 
too much to give up now.

1369
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,140
I have to believe there's a way to rank up.

1370
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:50,810
I tried practicing every jump that
I remembered from the Parkour Temple.

1371
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:54,660
Most of the jumps I saw were either 
fences, trap doors, or ladders.

1372
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,440
And I used my entire time in the training grounds 
practicing those jumps.

1373
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:03,130
By the end of the hour, I felt like I had 
unlocked parkour abilities I've never had before.

1374
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:06,390
I was speedrunning through 
fence jumps and trap door jumps easily.

1375
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:09,620
Three-block jumps weren't even 
a challenge for me by the end of my training.

1376
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:12,970
And that's how I knew that it was 
time to head to the Parkour Temple

1377
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,850
and do the course to become a Parkour Master.

1378
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:18,110
Yes, sir. He's heading to the Parkour Temple now.

1379
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,820
Don't worry, sir. I have something planned.

1380
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,540
I can promise you he's not making it out alive.

1381
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:22,550
This was it.
I can promise you he's not making it out alive.

1382
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:23,290
This was it.

1383
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:26,000
It was time to start the journey 
up the Parkour Temple.

1384
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,870
The last time I made this climb, 
I had a Totem of Undying for a second chance.

1385
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:32,560
But this time around, 
there would be no second chances.

1386
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,490
This was my last and only run.

1387
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:37,930
If I don't make every single one of these jumps 
in the parkour course,

1388
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:41,420
this would be the last view I ever have 
of Parkour Civilization.

1389
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,310
But that's how parkour life is.

1390
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:44,980
You either rise or you fall.

1391
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,690
You can never stay in the same place.

1392
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,360
And I had decided that I was gonna be the one to rise.

1393
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,090
I got to the top of the ladder 
and it was time to start the parkour course.

1394
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:55,410
Any fall from this height would be the death of me.

1395
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,600
But the fence jumps weren't what 
I was worried about.

1396
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,660
It was this, the impossible jump.

1397
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,730
This is when I find out if 
the secret path is real or not.

1398
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,190
I studied where the barrier block was in my house.

1399
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,320
If I wanted to land on the barrier, 
I would have to walk off the fence.

1400
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,090
If I jumped, I would miss the block.

1401
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:11,860
And that's assuming it was even there.

1402
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,700
But there's only one way to find out.

1403
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,460
I walked off the ledge and I was alive.

1404
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,120
It was here.

1405
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,720
The secret path was real.

1406
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,400
Now I knew it was possible.

1407
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,860
It was possible to become a Parkour Master.

1408
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,570
I looked around for where to go next

1409
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,530
and I saw the outline of 
a barrier three blocks to my left.

1410
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:31,750
And I saw the staircase of barriers 
that would lead up back onto the parkour course.

1411
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:35,250
I've never done invisible parkour before, 
but there's a first time for everything.

1412
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,140
I made the three-block jump 
and I was on the secret path.

1413
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,160
I didn't understand.

1414
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,480
Did someone make the secret path or was

1415
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,330
the course designed like this from the beginning?

1416
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:47,100
Either way, however the secret path got there,
 it got me back on the course.

1417
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,890
And now I was gonna have to 
make every jump first try.

1418
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:53,600
Thankfully, I got past the fence section,
 but now I was on the trap doors.

1419
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,930
Trapped doors were only 
a quarter of the size of a regular block,

1420
00:58:56,930 --> 00:59:00,100
meaning if I missed the jump by even a little,
 it would be game over.

1421
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,630
This next jump was a three-block diagonal jump.

1422
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:04,690
I didn't practice this jump, but I made it.

1423
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:08,680
I had made it past the trap doors,
 but now I was on the regular doors.

1424
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:12,690
I had almost no experience with door jumps,
 but I knew I had to be careful.

1425
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:16,160
If I wasn't paying attention 
and I opened one of the doors the wrong way,

1426
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,360
I could get knocked off,

1427
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,020
and there would be no Totem of Undying 
to save me this time.

1428
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,080
The jumps kept getting harder and harder,

1429
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,990
and each jump I felt like I was 
barely hanging on the edge.

1430
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:27,700
But it didn't matter as long as 
I was staying on the course.

1431
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,460
One by one, I kept 
making the jumps and I was getting

1432
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,000
higher and higher off the ground.

1433
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,600
The last door jump was 
a three-and-a-half block jump.

1434
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,250
It was far, but it wasn't gonna be 
the jump that stopped me from ranking up.

1435
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:41,870
I didn't like thinking about the fact 
that this course had no room for error.

1436
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,200
When I ranked up before, 
at least the course had blocks

1437
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,780
to potentially break my fall, but here,
 there was nothing that could save me.

1438
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:52,020
Luckily, I made it past the door section, 
and now I was on to the ladder section.

1439
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:55,790
Everything was going smoothly until 
I found something I've never seen before.

1440
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:57,720
Is this jump even possible?

1441
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,380
This is a two-block vertical jump.

1442
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,590
I've never seen this jump before, 
but I figured it had to be possible.

1443
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:04,930
I went for it, and I made it.

1444
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:07,990
And that's when I saw 
one of the hardest jumps I've ever seen.

1445
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:09,520
Oh, no, this could be the end of me.

1446
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,540
Come on, please hang on!

1447
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,990
Oh, that was too close.

1448
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:14,300
I was inches away from slipping off the ladder,

1449
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,910
but by some miracle, I was still on the course.

1450
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:19,700
Now, I was parkouring on fully-grown trees.

1451
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,930
I didn't even know trees still existed 
in Parkour Civilization,

1452
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:25,040
but I didn't have time to focus on that right now.

1453
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,000
I was looking at the last jumps 
and I realized I was almost at the top.

1454
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,690
I was actually gonna do it.

1455
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:32,520
All right, where do I jump to now—

1456
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,420
What the? What is going on?

1457
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,060
What is—

1458
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,390
Wait, wait, WAIT, NOOO!

1459
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,150
I was too late to realize.

1460
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:41,330
I opened my eyes and I was 
still on the tree with two hearts left.

1461
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:42,320
What happened?

1462
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,830
Was that a part of the course?

1463
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:45,750
Ha ha. That is impressive.

1464
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:48,920
I thought the TNT would do the trick,
 but you just wanna stay alive.

1465
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,570
What the... Who are you?

1466
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:51,620
What are you doing here?

1467
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,610
I'm so confused. What is going on?

1468
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:56,130
Oh, please don't tell me 
you thought you were gonna rank up.

1469
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,640
You? You were a Noob. You don't belong up there.

1470
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,780
You could never be a Parkour Master.

1471
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,420
You belong at the bottom level.

1472
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,140
You were a Noob.

1473
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,260
You were born to be one and you'll always be one.

1474
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,250
And now I gotta finish the job.

1475
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,960
Prepare for a parkour battle.

1476
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,320
Oh god, a parkour battle is 
not what I need right now.

1477
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,900
I only have two hearts left.

1478
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:17,020
That means if I fail to defend any parkour attack,
 that will be the end of me.

1479
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,600
And to think I actually had a chance of ranking up.

1480
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,720
Say goodbye to Parkour Civilization.

1481
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,940
The battle starts now.

1482
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:26,110
I attack you with a two-block diagonal vertical jump.

1483
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:28,730
Whoever this was severely underestimated me.

1484
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,760
I've beaten a Master in a parkour battle,

1485
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,040
and I sure wasn't gonna get out to a jump like that.

1486
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,620
There's no point in fighting back.

1487
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,980
Your fate is inevitable.

1488
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,710
I didn't listen to the Parkour Pro.

1489
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:40,950
I knew that as long as I could parkour, 
I was still in this.

1490
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:42,950
Now, I couldn't afford to play it safe.

1491
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,940
I needed an attack that would 
finish him once and for all,

1492
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:48,630
and that meant doing a jump I've never done before.

1493
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:49,620
Come on, please make it.

1494
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:50,910
Ohoho, I did it!

1495
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:52,660
No, no, what was that?

1496
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,610
What was that jump?

1497
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:56,380
Well, that would be a 
two-block downwards backwards jump.

1498
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,460
Wait, sorry I messed up.

1499
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:00,430
It's actually a two-block downwards 
backwards diagonal jump.

1500
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:01,190
This was it.

1501
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:04,500
The Pro lined up at the edge of the block 
and jumped backwards.

1502
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,020
Come on, please, NOOOooo!

1503
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:09,710
I did it. I won the parkour battle, but against who?

1504
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:11,570
That was just a Parkour Pro.

1505
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,780
Why was another Pro trying to attack me?

1506
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,680
And why did they not want me to rank up?

1507
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,430
What was all that stuff he was saying about
 how I was born to be at the bottom?

1508
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:21,900
There was too much to think about,
 but I had to set that aside

1509
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:25,340
because now I still had to worry about 
surviving the parkour course,

1510
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,160
and not even just the parkour jumps.

1511
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,600
Who knows if there are 
more traps waiting for me ahead?

1512
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,370
I took a look at the rest of the course.

1513
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:36,720
I could see the final stretch of jumps,
 and all I had to do now was a slime block jump.

1514
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,450
Let's go!

1515
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:40,020
All the days I was using my custom slime block jump

1516
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,440
to get to my bed were just 
practiced for this moment.

1517
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,900
I jumped and I made it.

1518
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:47,210
Now I was standing on 
one of the final jumps of the course

1519
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,060
and I could see the doorway up ahead.

1520
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,450
And now were the three-block vertical jumps,

1521
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:53,140
but I've been practicing for this moment.

1522
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,120
I used my momentum to do all five jumps in a row.

1523
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,290
In less than 10 jumps, I would be a Parkour Master.

1524
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:00,730
Now I was at a tricky part.

1525
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:02,980
I've never even seen chain jumps before.

1526
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,440
But compared to surviving 
a surprise attack and parkour battle,

1527
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,830
it was nothing to me anymore.

1528
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:12,860
I made the final chain jump and I was 
one jump away from becoming a Parkour Master.

1529
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:13,520
This was it.

1530
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,500
This was what everything was leading up to.

1531
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,940
The old man that helped me, 
the Parkour Master that gave me the Totem,

1532
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:22,540
they all wanted me to make it to this point 
and I wasn't gonna let them down.

1533
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,090
I jumped and I made it.

1534
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:24,800
I did it.

1535
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,440
I... I actually did it.

1536
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,140
I turned around and looked at 
how high I was off the ground.

1537
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:32,220
I had beaten the course 
that no Pro even attempts to do.

1538
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,030
And now I'm about to rank up.

1539
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:35,380
Once I stepped through these doors,

1540
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,210
I will no longer be a Parkour Pro.

1541
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:39,290
I will be a Parkour Master.

1542
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:42,260
The door opened revealing
 an entirely different room.

1543
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:44,340
All of the walls were made up of quartz.

1544
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,980
What was society even gonna look like up here?

1545
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,930
I couldn't describe it, but everything was so perfect

1546
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,540
compared to the layers down below.

1547
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:55,220
I looked over and I saw a lava parkour jump 
with dispensers in the middle.

1548
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,830
Oh, I know what this is.

1549
01:03:56,830 --> 01:04:00,420
This would hopefully be the last time 
I ever have to wear Pro boots again.

1550
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,640
I took off my boots and threw them in the lava.

1551
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,070
And now I just got to make sure 
I don't fail this jump.

1552
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:08,640
I jumped through the dispensers 
and I was equipped with golden boots.

1553
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,420
I was now officially a Parkour Master.

1554
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,680
The last time I ranked up to become a Pro,

1555
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,600
there were people working in the Parkour Temple,

1556
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,250
but now I don't see anyone here.

1557
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:20,660
I realized how different society was 
between the Noob and Pro levels.

1558
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:23,080
So how much different could this society be?

1559
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,280
Well, I guess there's only one way to find out.

1560
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,980
I walked up the stairs and I started to see 
the inside of the Parkour Temple.

1561
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,770
All right, I think I'm ready to see 
what society's like up here.

1562
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:34,940
I walked up the stairs 
into the Parkour Master society.

1563
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,520
Oh my...

1564
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,480
Becoming a master of Parkour Civilization wasn't easy.

1565
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,820
I had to risk my life finding a way 
past an impossible jump.

1566
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:47,160
I had to complete parkour jumps that 
I've never even done before.

1567
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,460
I even had to survive a surprise attack 
while trying to rank up.

1568
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,440
But no matter what challenge I faced, 
nothing stopped me from

1569
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,720
ranking up to become a Parkour Master.

1570
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:59,700
Now I get to be the first Parkour Pro 
to see what society is like up here.

1571
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,440
Oh my.

1572
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,760
This is what Parkour Civilization 
looks like as a Master.

1573
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,010
Up here, only the best of the best 
can survive all of the jumps.

1574
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:11,220
One missed jump, and I would 
rank down back to a Parkour Pro,

1575
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,790
and all of my work to get up here 
would have been for nothing.

1576
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:16,750
And now it looks like I'm gonna be 
fighting for my life every jump.

1577
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,520
As a Parkour Noob, 
I only had to do one-block jumps.

1578
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,040
When I became a Pro, those one-block jumps 
turned into two-block jumps.

1579
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:27,220
And now, as a Parkour Master, 
everywhere I look is a three-block jump.

1580
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:29,840
Except now up here, there are parkour highways.

1581
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,090
It seemed like taking the highway was a little easier

1582
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:34,430
since the glass jumps were about 
two and a half blocks.

1583
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:38,540
I was expecting life to be different up here,
 but I did not think it would look like this.

1584
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:40,280
I mean, were these even houses?

1585
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,330
These were more like skyscrapers.

1586
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:45,770
Wait, could I actually buy a skyscraper as a Master?

1587
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:49,840
I looked up and way up high, I saw 
a Parkour Master easily making the jumps.

1588
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,200
And just when I thought 
he was gonna die from fall damage,

1589
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,920
he just caught himself with 
a water bucket and moved on.

1590
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,820
I've never heard of 
water bucket parkour being a thing,

1591
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,770
but that's when I remembered the Parkour Master that I battled

1592
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:01,980
came down the same way.

1593
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:06,160
So Parkour Masters can use water
 to never take fall damage?

1594
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,830
All right, well, it looks like I gotta go 
find myself a water bucket.

1595
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:12,890
I made my way over to what looked like to be 
some sort of parkour staircase.

1596
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:16,050
And this definitely didn't look like 
an easy staircase to climb.

1597
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:17,930
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1598
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:21,240
Oh, no, my first day as a Parkour Master
 and I'm already in trouble?

1599
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,050
I turned around but didn't see anybody

1600
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:25,510
until a Parkour Master 
dropped down out of nowhere.

1601
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:26,640
It seems like you're new here.

1602
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,710
You should probably get off the staircase 
if you don't have your water bucket yet.

1603
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:31,420
Okay, I'm not gonna fight back on this one,

1604
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,300
not trying to make enemies on my first day.

1605
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:36,590
The Master explained that I shouldn't be 
going up high without a water bucket,

1606
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:39,170
because one missed jump 
and I'll die from fall damage.

1607
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:41,700
And he said Masters never die from fall damage.

1608
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,160
Okay, so how do I get a water bucket then?

1609
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,440
Do you even have a house yet?

1610
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,570
Uh, no.

1611
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,740
All right, buddy, you should probably 
get a house first.

1612
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:49,780
Like that one over there.

1613
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:53,070
You need something on the ground level, 
something where you don't have to go up high for.

1614
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:53,800
Are you serious?

1615
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,880
These are actually houses? 
Uh, okay, so how do I get a house?

1616
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,400
The Master showed me the building 
where I could buy my parkour skyscraper.

1617
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,550
Uh, you're new here. I'll help you out a little bit.

1618
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:06,620
I'm kinda rich, so just take this and hopefully 
that will help you buy your first house.

1619
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:07,610
You're rich?

1620
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:08,570
Wait, what does that mean?

1621
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:11,740
It was already clear that I knew nothing about 
what life was like up here.

1622
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,580
The Parkour Master dropped me five oak blocks.

1623
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:16,060
Why would he drop me these?

1624
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,500
Wait, how much is a skyscraper gonna cost?

1625
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:22,990
I made my way over to the shop where I was gonna
 buy my first house as a Parkour Master.

1626
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:27,350
I walked inside and this store looked nothing like 
all of the other shops I bought houses from.

1627
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:30,010
Instead, there was just one giant hole in the middle.

1628
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:33,330
Okay, don't tell me I have to 
do this jump to buy a skyscraper.

1629
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:34,540
Is this even possible?

1630
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,810
Okay, clearly you have no idea how this works.

1631
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:38,200
You have to build your jump, buddy.

1632
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,060
Let's go! I can build my own jump 
to pay for my house.

1633
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:43,990
Now I understand why the Parkour Master 
gave me these blocks.

1634
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,360
All right, what am I gonna build?

1635
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,470
Wait, how do I even know this is gonna 
be enough to buy the house?

1636
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:50,430
Can't you just tell me how much the house costs?

1637
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:51,690
No, that's your job.

1638
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:54,910
Just warning you, if you don't pay enough,
 I'm not gonna sell you a house.

1639
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:56,440
Okay, I have to guess the price.

1640
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,120
That's just great.

1641
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,450
Let's just hope this 
three-block diagonal jump works.

1642
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,110
Nice.

1643
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,340
All right? Did I get the house?

1644
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:02,680
Bro, you're kidding, right?

1645
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,530
You're trying to buy a skyscraper.

1646
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:05,780
Why would you think that would work?

1647
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:08,590
If I had a dirt house to sell,
 I wouldn't even give it to you for that.

1648
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:09,610
Okay, that's not good.

1649
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:11,740
Now I just wasted three of the blocks I had.

1650
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:15,710
How am I possibly gonna make a jump 
hard enough to buy a skyscraper with one block?

1651
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:16,480
Okay, let's see.

1652
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,530
This is a three-block jump 
and then into a two-block jump.

1653
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:21,930
Oh god, I have an idea, and I don't like it.

1654
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:25,410
But if I'm gonna buy a parkour skyscraper, 
I think this is my only choice.

1655
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:26,460
This is such a bad idea.

1656
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,280
Why am I doing this?

1657
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,490
Whatever, I'm just gonna go for it.

1658
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:29,500
One, two.

1659
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,560
Oh, I cannot believe I just made that.

1660
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,630
I've never even seen a 360, 
but you just paid me with two in a row!

1661
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:37,800
This is incredible.

1662
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,870
Let me show you to your parkour skyscraper.

1663
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:42,750
If there's one thing I know about 
life in Parkour Civilization,

1664
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,160
it's that a 360 can solve everything.

1665
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,660
All right, here's your new house.

1666
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:50,410
I have to be the first person in history to have 
bought a house on the Noob level,

1667
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:52,350
the Pro level, and the Master level.

1668
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:54,060
I cannot wait to check this ou—

1669
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,380
Wait, how do I even get up here?

1670
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,400
Oh, yeah.

1671
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,010
Usually when people buy this house, 
they water bucket from

1672
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,620
all the way up there to get inside.

1673
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,670
I have to jump from all the way up there just to get up one block?

1674
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:04,150
No, no.

1675
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:05,900
Since you paid me a lot, I'll help you out.

1676
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,730
The guy told me I could use this block instead of water bucketing,

1677
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:10,410
but he said as a Parkour Master,

1678
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:12,860
if you're caught using this, 
everyone will make fun of you.

1679
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:17,080
That means I'm gonna have to get a water bucket 
before I become a social outcast up here.

1680
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:21,340
All right, time to check out the biggest house 
I've ever bought in Parkour Civilization.

1681
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:26,130
The downside about being a Parkour Master 
is every jump in my life is now so much harder.

1682
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:29,030
The houses up here had 
so many more spaces to fall through.

1683
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:31,360
I even had to jump if I wanted to go on the couch.

1684
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,230
But that's what it means to be 
a Master in Parkour Civilization.

1685
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:37,920
Parkour Masters are never supposed to fall,
 no matter how hard the jump is.

1686
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,180
So, I guess I have to do all these glass jumps

1687
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,660
every time I wanna get to the top floor of my house.

1688
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,850
When I climbed up the ladder, 
I was in my very own garden.

1689
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:49,500
I didn't even know nature like this 
still existed in Parkour Civilization,

1690
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,370
but now I have it in my house.

1691
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:54,870
This entire level of civilization 
was still so crazy to me.

1692
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:57,020
I couldn't even believe 
half of the things I was seeing.

1693
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:59,270
Never in my life would I have thought I would have

1694
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,530
to swim up a waterfall 
to get to the top floor of my house.

1695
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:04,490
I was so amazed by everything around me

1696
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:07,780
that I didn't even pay attention to 
the fact that I was at two hearts.

1697
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:11,300
If I missed one of these jumps and took fall damage, 
it might be the end of me.

1698
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,350
But I'm a Master now, so I never miss jum—

1699
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:13,820
No!

1700
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,820
I missed one parkour jump 
and I took one heart of damage,

1701
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,410
leaving me with one heart left.

1702
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:21,740
I was so focused on buying a house 
that I didn't even realize I had

1703
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,620
no food or no regeneration.

1704
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:27,180
I was still suffering the consequences from 
the ambush at the Parkour Temple.

1705
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:31,350
Now that I had time to process the situation, 
there was no way that person acted alone.

1706
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:35,050
Someone didn't want me to rank up, 
and whoever that is is still out there.

1707
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:39,310
I didn't know, maybe it was another Parkour Master,
 or maybe it was someone else.

1708
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:43,350
All I knew is that I was gonna have to 
figure out something quick if I wanted to survive.

1709
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:46,640
If I missed one more jump, 
my entire journey would be for nothing.

1710
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,930
So if I was gonna have any chance at surviving,

1711
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:50,930
I was gonna need to find a place to get food.

1712
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:54,830
I went down the parkour highway until I saw 
a massive building in the distance.

1713
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:57,010
I was just hoping that this was a place to get food

1714
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:00,070
because I had four hunger bars left 
and I don't even wanna think about

1715
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:02,240
what might happen if I lose the ability to sprint.

1716
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:06,520
I walked into the building and so far 
I didn't see anything that resembled food.

1717
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:09,410
All I saw were dispensers and hoppers on the wall.

1718
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:13,210
All of the dispensers had different types of 
parkour items listed above them.

1719
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:16,710
Maybe this was a place I could go and 
get more blocks to build more jumps.

1720
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:17,950
Or maybe not.

1721
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:19,430
Why don't these machines even work?

1722
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:20,280
I'm not getting anything.

1723
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,350
Hey buddy, you're not seriously trying to
 rob the Parkour Bank, are you?

1724
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:24,950
The Parkour Bank?

1725
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:28,570
I already knew parkour was how 
people paid each other in Parkour Civilization,

1726
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:29,470
but this was different.

1727
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:32,770
Someone walked up with a piece of paper 
and put it into the dispenser.

1728
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:34,810
In exchange, they got wood blocks for it.

1729
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:37,250
I realized the paper the guy put into the dispenser

1730
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,600
was something I was already familiar with.

1731
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,030
It must have been a daily task paper, which means

1732
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:44,700
not even being a Parkour Master 
can get me out of work.

1733
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,270
On the other side of the bank,
 I saw a staircase that was

1734
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:49,620
definitely too hard to do with one heart left.

1735
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:53,180
Hey man, I don't mean to assume anything,
 but the top floor is for people with money.

1736
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,800
You can come back when you're rich, though.

1737
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,700
How does every Parkour Master know 
that this is my first day here?

1738
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,170
All right, well, I found the bank, 
but that didn't help me at all.

1739
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:02,830
The situation was getting worse as I kept going on.

1740
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:05,220
I was now down to three-and-a-half hunger bars.

1741
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:08,240
If I didn't get food within a few minutes,
 I would lose my sprint,

1742
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,410
and every three-block jump that 
I've been doing would be impossible.

1743
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,210
Okay, I really hope this place sells food.

1744
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:14,620
Yeah, this is the place for food.

1745
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,820
You just gotta build your jump.

1746
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:17,480
Oh, this is it. I'm done for.

1747
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,900
I have no blocks left.

1748
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,790
I have no way of paying for 
anything in Parkour Civilization.

1749
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:25,040
I'm gonna be the first 
Parkour Master in history to starve.

1750
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,310
How embarrassing is that?

1751
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:27,010
Wait a minute.

1752
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,010
Unless,

1753
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,790
<i>Parkour can be used for anything.</i>

1754
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,850
<i>And that includes bribing parkour pros.</i>

1755
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:34,510
Could I bribe a Parkour Master for food?

1756
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:35,340
Would that work?

1757
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,500
I mean, maybe it cou—

1758
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,280
What the?

1759
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,680
Where... did that person just come from?

1760
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,490
Oh my god.

1761
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,090
She probably fell from all the way up there.

1762
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:43,980
Well, oh well, free blocks for me.

1763
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,040
Let's go, I'm saved!

1764
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:49,150
In my entire time in Parkour Civilization,
 I've never even seen ice jumps.

1765
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:51,310
But now wasn't the time to be scared of jumps.

1766
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:52,240
I needed the food.

1767
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,850
All right, what does two
 three-block ice jumps get me?

1768
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:56,900
Dude, you seriously paid that much?

1769
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,200
Wait, what do you mean paid that much?

1770
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:58,960
Did I pay a lot?

1771
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,750
Ice jumps were apparently 
worth a lot in Parkour Civilization

1772
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,980
because I got 64 golden carrots.

1773
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,080
Please come back, bro.

1774
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:05,800
Anytime.

1775
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,570
Let's go!

1776
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:09,920
I'm not gonna be the 
first Parkour Master in history to starve.

1777
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,920
Now, I actually have a chance 
to start living life as a Parkour Master.

1778
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,560
I don't even know what to do now.

1779
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,770
Do I go to work?

1780
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:19,110
Or do I get a water bucket?

1781
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:21,220
Oh yeah, I'm definitely getting a water bucket.

1782
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:24,010
I took the parkour highway 
until I found a different building.

1783
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:26,750
Hopefully, this would be the place where 
I could get a water bucket

1784
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:30,280
because it didn't really seem like 
I was a Parkour Master until I got one.

1785
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:34,950
I walked into the building and I saw 
a giant glass staircase with a small platform on top.

1786
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:38,210
And on the floor, it looked like 
there was some sort of target.

1787
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:39,630
You're here for a water bucket?

1788
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:40,810
Oh, uh, yeah.

1789
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:42,250
Is this the place I get one?

1790
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,370
Ha, ha, ha. You don't just get one.

1791
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:46,340
You pay for one with your life.

1792
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:49,530
Climb up to the top of the staircase 
and grab a water bucket.

1793
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:51,110
If you make it, you keep it.

1794
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:53,600
Of course, I have to risk my life yet again.

1795
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,100
Getting a water bucket was the only thing 
different in Parkour Civilization.

1796
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,270
Usually, you pay for everything 
with parkour, but not this time.

1797
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,200
It didn't matter, though.

1798
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,050
The fear of death never stopped me before.

1799
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:04,980
Yes, sir. Somehow he ranked up.

1800
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,660
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

1801
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:10,450
Maybe he dies from the water bucket, 
but if he doesn't, we'll be there to stop him.

1802
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:13,230
I somehow made it to the top of the glass staircase.

1803
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:17,100
I can confidently say that stairs are 
the worst thing about being a Parkour Master.

1804
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,520
But right now, stairs were the least of my worries.

1805
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,190
I opened the chest to see a bunch of water buckets.

1806
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:24,430
The only way I'm gonna be 
able to keep one of these

1807
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:27,640
is if I go for the water bucket jump 
and make it successfully.

1808
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,720
If I make it, I'll have the ability 
to unlock an entirely new level of parkour.

1809
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:35,060
And if I don't, well, my entire 
journey's been for nothing.

1810
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:37,530
But that's the way life is in Parkour Civilization.

1811
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:38,760
You jump to survive.

1812
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,580
And I happen to be pretty good at it.

1813
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,360
Why did I do this to myself?

1814
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,590
I should have never ranked up.

1815
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:46,530
Life as a Parkour Noob was so much easier.

1816
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:49,600
I gotta say, life as a Parkour Master is awesome.

1817
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,070
I mean, this is what it's like being 
at the top of Parkour Civilization.

1818
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:54,110
No way!

1819
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:59,020
Did I seriously just catch another Master doing 
a one-block jump to get to his house?

1820
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,620
Aha... no, I don't even know how this got here.

1821
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:04,650
Okay, now I have to start 
gonna my house the real way,

1822
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:07,300
and that means taking a trip 
on the parkour staircase.

1823
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,810
Here in Parkour Civilization,

1824
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:11,590
Masters should never be 
seen doing one-block jumps.

1825
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:15,150
If you're caught, you will basically become 
a laughing stock in Parkour City.

1826
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:18,530
I tried keeping the one-block jump 
to my house for as long as possible,

1827
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:21,130
because I was avoiding getting 
to my house the real way.

1828
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,110
And that's because the real way to my house sucks.

1829
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:27,770
If I miss even one of these water bucket jumps, 
it would be game over for me.

1830
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:32,060
But everyone up here knows that 
the best Parkour Masters never take fall damage.

1831
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,240
And I was gonna be one of the best.

1832
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,200
Please don't let me die.

1833
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,460
Oh, thank you.

1834
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:38,160
All that just to get to my house.

1835
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,880
But this is the price I paid 
to become a Parkour Master.

1836
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,760
I defied death too many times to count to rank up.

1837
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,190
And now, as a Master in Parkour Civilization,

1838
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:49,450
the only way to survive is by doing 
the hardest possible jumps.

1839
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:52,690
These were jumps I could only dream 
of when I was a Parkour Noob.

1840
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:54,290
But now that I earned my water bucket,

1841
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:58,220
I have the ability to become 
the greatest Master in Parkour Civilization.

1842
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:02,450
My first days on this level were confusing, 
but now I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of it.

1843
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:06,340
As a Parkour Pro, I was required 
to do a daily task every single day.

1844
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:09,880
But now as a Master, I can choose 
to do a task whenever I want.

1845
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,930
Instead of being paid in practice time, 
the Masters get paid with blocks.

1846
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:17,110
As a Master, if you wanna pay for things, 
you have to build your own jumps.

1847
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:20,890
That means the more blocks you have, 
the more powerful you are as a Master.

1848
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:24,630
And right now, I can't make many parkour jumps, 
so that's why I gotta work.

1849
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:26,120
Uh, parkour delivery here.

1850
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,690
Come in! Alright, let's hope I can do this job well.

1851
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:30,810
Hey there, you wanted some parkour built, right?

1852
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:31,820
Yeah, that's right.

1853
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,390
I ordered my new chain couch.

1854
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:34,750
You can put it right over there.

1855
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:39,300
I can't say I've heard of a chain couch before, 
but I guess there's a first time for everything.

1856
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,610
Uh, all right, I think I built this right.

1857
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:42,400
Is this what you wanted?

1858
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,480
Oh, yeah, this is a real couch.

1859
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,410
Maybe if you're as rich as me one day, 
you can afford one of these.

1860
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:48,400
Uh, sure.

1861
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,850
Well, I hope you enjoy your new—

1862
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:51,180
Oh, shoot! No!

1863
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:54,310
Bro! Am I seriously not gonna get a tip?

1864
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,500
Dude, that guy said he was rich too.

1865
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,630
I could have gotten some ice blocks or something.

1866
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:02,550
The truth about being a Parkour Master is 
that people don't always get along.

1867
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:05,070
Not only do you have to survive every single jump,

1868
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:07,790
but you have to be ready 
to defend yourself with parkour.

1869
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.

1870
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:10,210
What do you think you're doing?

1871
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:12,600
Everyone knows I'm the guy who sells houses.

1872
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,940
Go and take a different job.

1873
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:14,890
Wait, what do you mean?

1874
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:17,070
My job today is to sell houses.

1875
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:18,560
You can't just skip one day?

1876
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,810
Come on, man, I need the money.

1877
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:20,440
That's it.

1878
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,410
Parkour battle!

1879
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:22,830
You and me right now.

1880
01:17:22,830 --> 01:17:27,400
And by defend yourself, I mean being prepared 
for a random parkour battle at any point.

1881
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,420
For my first move, I attacked 
with a three-block diagonal jump

1882
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:32,850
into a three-block vertical diagonal jump.

1883
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:36,900
I thought it was a strong attack, but 
the Parkour Master clearly had no problem with it.

1884
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:40,450
Now it was his turn to attack, 
and I was in serious trouble.

1885
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:43,040
The Parkour Master built a three-block chain jump.

1886
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:45,770
Let's see you tried to defend 
against this attack, buddy.

1887
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:48,720
Wait, I don't even have chains to build with.

1888
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,860
I can't do this jump.

1889
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:54,640
Then you have officially lost the parkour battle, 
and the selling house job is mine again.

1890
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,570
And there it was.

1891
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,970
That was my first time losing a parkour battle.

1892
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:01,440
But that's just a part of the learning process 
for being a Parkour Master.

1893
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,970
But even though I've learned so much, 
there's one thing that I've yet to figure out,

1894
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:07,830
and that's how to get to 
the top of the Parkour Temple.

1895
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:12,890
If I make it up there, I could potentially be 
the Parkour Champion, but I didn't see a way up.

1896
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:16,860
Back when I was a Parkour Pro, I could see 
the path on the side of the wall to rank up,

1897
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,390
but now there's nothing here.

1898
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:20,170
That's because you can't see it.

1899
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:23,550
It's said that only the 
Parkour Champion knows the way up.

1900
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:27,150
Standing behind me was the Master 
that I beat in my first parkour battle.

1901
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:29,500
He was the one who gave me the Totem of Undying

1902
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,880
and helped me find the way past 
the impossible jump.

1903
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:34,750
Without his help, I would have 
never become a Parkour Master,

1904
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,550
and I wouldn't even be alive right now.

1905
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:39,540
I knew giving you that Totem 
of Undying was a good choice.

1906
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:44,090
Now that you ranked up, you have the chance 
to save all of Parkour Civilization

1907
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:45,570
by becoming the Champion.

1908
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:47,650
Save Parkour Civilization?

1909
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:49,050
Wait, what are you talking about?

1910
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:52,380
Why do I need to be the one 
to become the Parkour Champion?

1911
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,970
You don't understand. We are at war.

1912
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,930
We thought all hope was lost. Before you ranked up.

1913
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:59,030
You don't understand.

1914
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:01,960
People aren't supposed to rank up, 
but you did it anyways.

1915
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,480
You need to come with me now.

1916
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,430
What is going on?

1917
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:08,440
There's a parkour war and somehow 
I'm supposed to be the Champion?

1918
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,340
Oh, what am I getting myself into?

1919
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,810
I should have never ranked up.

1920
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:13,090
I was happy in my mansion.

1921
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:15,320
The Master brought me into the Parkour Temple

1922
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,020
and I followed him 
until he showed me a secret room.

1923
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,730
When I walked inside, I saw a small-scale version

1924
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:23,630
of a map of the entire Parkour Civilization.

1925
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:25,630
The Master said he had a mission for me.

1926
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:30,220
He told me to travel as far north as I could 
and find the highest parkour highway there is.

1927
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:33,650
He told me there's a building there 
that's extremely difficult to get into.

1928
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:37,580
But if I could get into it, I could get 
the truth about Parkour Civilization.

1929
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:41,650
He told me to go at night, and if I succeed, 
I might be able to save everyone.

1930
01:19:41,650 --> 01:19:42,390
It was time.

1931
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:44,080
I woke up in the middle of the night.

1932
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,480
This was a stealth mission.

1933
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,370
If everything went according to plan,

1934
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,630
I would get in and get out and no one would see me.

1935
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:53,840
And obviously, that's assuming 
the Parkour Master isn't leading me into a trap,

1936
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,740
but for whatever it's worth, I trust him.

1937
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:59,950
If he was trying to stop me from ranking up, 
he wouldn't have given me the Totem of Undying.

1938
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:03,610
That means I can only assume if he wanted me 
dead, I would have been dead already.

1939
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:06,360
But at this point, I wasn't doing it 
for the Parkour Master.

1940
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:07,570
I was doing it for me.

1941
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:11,360
If there was any chance I could figure out 
the truth about Parkour Civilization,

1942
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,330
I was gonna take it.

1943
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:17,020
All I know is, someone tried to stop me from 
ranking up, and this place might give me answers.

1944
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:19,060
I traveled north like the Master told me to.

1945
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:22,740
And all the way at the top, 
I saw the parkour highway I needed to get to.

1946
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:24,240
There was no turning back now.

1947
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,460
Going up this might be a one-way trip.

1948
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:29,830
But if what I was doing actually 
could save Parkour Civilization,

1949
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:31,490
then someone's got to be the one to do it.

1950
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:32,460
So why not me?

1951
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,380
Now that I was at the top of the staircase,

1952
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:36,920
getting to the parkour highway 
was a different story.

1953
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,250
I didn't even know if this jump was possible.

1954
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:40,560
Oh, I'm gonna regret this.

1955
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,020
I backed up to get momentum and I jumped.

1956
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:43,820
No, no, no!

1957
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,610
I thought it was too short, but I made it.

1958
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:47,630
Okay, that was way too close.

1959
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:49,800
That better be the last time 
I do something like that.

1960
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,050
Given that this place I was trying 
to find wasn't supposed to be found,

1961
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:54,740
that probably wouldn't be the case.

1962
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:57,830
I kept going on the parkour highway 
until I saw a building.

1963
01:20:57,830 --> 01:21:00,920
This one looked different 
than all of the other buildings in Parkour City,

1964
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,680
and I had a feeling that it 
wasn't gonna be easy to get to.

1965
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,440
But that's why the Master sent me,

1966
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,130
the guy who's <i>never</i> failed a jump before...

1967
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:09,430
Yeah, let's pretend that's true.

1968
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:13,120
The entrance to the building looked like 
it was guarded by a difficult parkour course.

1969
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,530
As long as there were no people around, 
I was just fine with doing parkour.

1970
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:19,500
But if people were to show up 
and challenge me to a parkour battle,

1971
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,800
well, it's been a good run.

1972
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,950
This next jump was a four-block jump.

1973
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:26,320
I don't think I've ever done 
a four-block jump straight up before.

1974
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,750
But the Master said 
that this mission would be difficult,

1975
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,850
and if there's someone to do it, it was gonna be me.

1976
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:33,540
I got momentum, and I made the four-block jump.

1977
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,680
Oh, four-block jump down, and now,

1978
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,190
Oh my god, what is this?

1979
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:39,720
I stood on a path of ice blocks, and at the end,

1980
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,450
there was a jump way too far to even comprehend.

1981
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:45,150
This could have been a five, no, six-block jump.

1982
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,240
I couldn't believe it.

1983
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,320
I tried looking around for barrier blocks.

1984
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,360
Maybe there was a secret path to this as well,

1985
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,340
but I found nothing.

1986
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,640
Somehow I was gonna have to make this jump.

1987
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:56,720
And I think I had an idea 
of how I might be able to do it.

1988
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,930
Okay, well, I get one chance of this.

1989
01:21:58,930 --> 01:22:02,020
Oh man, if only I was rich enough 
to buy ice blocks to practice.

1990
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:04,100
Oh, I do not wanna do that again.

1991
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,330
There must be a parkour god looking out for me.

1992
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:07,920
Okay, back to the secret mission.

1993
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,710
Now, I was just hoping I didn't walk into an ambush.

1994
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:14,940
I walked inside and I saw a giant hole in the floor 
with some parkour jumps up top.

1995
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,250
I was thankful that I didn't 
see anyone waiting for me.

1996
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:21,130
And what I wasn't thankful 
for was this glass pane staircase.

1997
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:25,130
Oh man, why do they have to make staircases 
so complicated in Parkour Civilization?

1998
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:26,830
This was supposed to be a stealth mission,

1999
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:29,840
but the staircase is making it really hard 
for that to be possible.

2000
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,090
After too long, I made it up 
the staircase into the top floor.

2001
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:34,800
I looked around but didn't see anyone.

2002
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,050
All I saw was some weird pedestal 
in the middle and some giant screen.

2003
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:40,140
What is this thing?

2004
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:41,050
This looks so...

2005
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:42,010
What the...

2006
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:43,670
<i>Look, I told you it was possible.</i>

2007
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:44,570
<i>No way.</i>

2008
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:46,160
<i>That was actually incredible.</i>

2009
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,320
<i>All right, well, I got my money's worth.</i>

2010
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,950
<i>Let's go! I got paid for parkour!</i>

2011
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:53,650
<i>If you want, I can keep making more parkour 
for you to do, and I'll pay you for it.</i>

2012
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:55,130
Whoa, what just happened?

2013
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:57,140
How did I see that vision?

2014
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,830
That's my memory, isn't it?

2015
01:22:58,830 --> 01:22:59,680
That's Seawatt.

2016
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,450
I've lived that before.

2017
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:02,220
What is going on?

2018
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:05,030
I walked over to the screen 
and opened the book on the desk.

2019
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:06,840
It said "Enter User."

2020
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,700
Well, I was here for information, wasn't I?

2021
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:10,000
Might as well see what this does.

2022
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,470
I put my name into the book 
and put it back on the desk

2023
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:14,130
and text appeared on the screen.

2024
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:15,160
"Rank: Noob."

2025
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:15,950
Wait, how?

2026
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,050
I'm a Master, though.

2027
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:20,130
But before I could think any further, 
someone appeared right behind me.

2028
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:22,440
Before they saw me, I ran and hid behind the bush.

2029
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,380
Oh, no, this is not good. This is not good.

2030
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:25,630
Oh, man.

2031
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:27,560
Going into work late today, I guess.

2032
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,780
Or early maybe, I don't know.

2033
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:33,240
So far the person didn't see me, 
but that's when someone else came into the room.

2034
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,840
It was Seawatt.

2035
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,470
I know him, don't I? He's from my memory.

2036
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:40,550
I saw him walk up to the desk 
and start putting something in the book.

2037
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:43,050
And the player that was 
on the pedestal started moving.

2038
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:46,630
I watched as this player 
with no boots walked up to a parkour jump

2039
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:48,640
and fail the one-block jump.

2040
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:50,400
And we got another Noob.

2041
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,220
Good.

2042
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:52,560
We needed more of those.

2043
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,130
What is going on here?

2044
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,320
You can come out from behind that bush, you know.

2045
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,780
Oh no, this is not good.

2046
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:59,060
Okay, time to improvise.

2047
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:01,220
I mean, bro, the bush is see-through.

2048
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:02,730
You really thought that was gonna work?

2049
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:04,590
Okay, can you just tell me what's going on?

2050
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:07,330
Why did I see you when I stepped on that pedestal?

2051
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:08,510
We know each other.

2052
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,750
That's our memory.

2053
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:10,370
Nope.

2054
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:12,800
That's just what every new person sees.

2055
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,830
It's a fake memory to make you think 
that parkour is how you succeed in life.

2056
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:21,180
I mean, why else would people parkour 
if it wasn't for money or social status?

2057
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,450
So it was all just a lie?

2058
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:24,910
I don't get it. What is this for?

2059
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:28,360
These three jumps, that new player 
just fell through on the first one.

2060
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:29,180
What happened to him?

2061
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,830
Seawatt explained that these three jumps decide

2062
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:34,940
whether a new player becomes 
a Noob, a Pro, or a Master.

2063
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:39,890
These three jumps right when you join 
Parkour Civilization decide your entire fate?

2064
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:40,800
How is that fair?

2065
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,100
It's not about fair. It's about order.

2066
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:45,910
If you can't parkour, 
you deserve to be at the bottom.

2067
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:47,800
This is so messed up. This is so messed up.

2068
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,790
How is this happening?

2069
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:50,240
I can't let this keep going on.

2070
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,920
I have to find a way to stop this.

2071
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,450
Okay, if I can attack him with a parkour jump, 
he has no choice but to battle me.

2072
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:57,700
I have to do an attack that he'll never be able to do.

2073
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,270
It's time to go for the 720.

2074
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:01,020
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

2075
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:03,770
I looked over and Seawatt 
already had an attack built.

2076
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:05,300
It was with candles.

2077
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,590
Yep, candle jump.

2078
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:10,070
One attack from this and it does 10 hearts, 
and that's good night for you.

2079
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:10,990
I was finished.

2080
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:13,220
I couldn't attack. I couldn't do anything.

2081
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:14,720
I was defenseless.

2082
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,330
So what happens now?

2083
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:19,160
Despite my best efforts 
to get rid of you, I couldn't do it.

2084
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:20,500
So someone else will.

2085
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:24,250
Seawatt placed down a parkour 
jump made out of brewing stands.

2086
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:27,150
I've never even heard of parkour 
with brewing stands before.

2087
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:29,510
Interesting thing about brewing stand jumps.

2088
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:31,120
They aren't just difficult,

2089
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,640
but they can deal any potion effect you want.

2090
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:34,230
This was it.

2091
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:36,430
I had no brewing stands to defend myself.

2092
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:39,130
I took the hit and slowly started fading away.

2093
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:41,330
Have fun with the Champion in the arena.

2094
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:45,180
No pressure at all, just one minute 
before I fight the Parkour Champion.

2095
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:47,700
All right, I'm gonna take 32 blocks.

2096
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:51,490
I really just hope there's a chance 
that the greatest player in Parkour Civilization

2097
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:53,150
doesn't know how to do a 360.

2098
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:57,020
I was now getting ready to fight 
the Parkour Champion in the arena.

2099
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:01,580
The worst part was, is that I was only 
allowed to bring in 64 blocks to fight with.

2100
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:04,580
I had no clue what the Parkour Champion 
was gonna attack me with.

2101
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:06,900
So, I decided to take some of every block.

2102
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,410
This was life or death.

2103
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:11,620
If by some miracle I could defend 
the Parkour Champion's attacks,

2104
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:15,680
I would have to use these blocks to build 
the hardest parkour jumps I've ever done.

2105
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,650
I wanted to believe that I could win, 
but deep down I knew

2106
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:20,780
that this could very well be the end of my journey.

2107
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:23,480
Before you step into the arena, 
drop all of your blocks.

2108
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,380
I need to count if you are bringing 64.

2109
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:26,530
These are the blocks I'm bringing.

2110
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:28,020
It should add up to 64.

2111
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:28,630
You're good.

2112
01:26:28,630 --> 01:26:30,720
You may now fight the Parkour Champion.

2113
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,850
This was it.

2114
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:35,650
One way or another, this would be my 
final battle in Parkour Civilization.

2115
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:38,920
The door opened and I stepped 
in to the Parkour Arena.

2116
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,100
It was time to fight.

2117
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,590
If I somehow beat the Parkour Champion,

2118
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:45,760
maybe I have a way to save 
everyone in Parkour Civilization.

2119
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:49,600
But if I lose, which let's be honest here, 
is very much possible.

2120
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,980
Well, let's just say I should 
have died a long time ago.

2121
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:55,520
I thought the Parkour Civilization 
I was living in was fair,

2122
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,900
and a place where everyone could 
parkour to rank up in society.

2123
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,020
But I was wrong.

2124
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:04,600
I discovered the truth that your entire fate 
is decided by three jumps.

2125
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,160
And there are people 
at the top of Parkour Civilization

2126
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,370
that will stop at nothing to keep this order.

2127
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:12,800
Unfortunately, I couldn't discover the truth 
without paying the price.

2128
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,510
And now there's nothing I can do.

2129
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:16,720
<i>Have fun with the Champion in the arena.</i>

2130
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,600
And now it's time to fight the Champio—

2131
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,440
Wait, what?

2132
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,130
You're not the Champion? Who are you?

2133
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:24,440
You're a Pro. What are you doing here?
 I thought I was fighting the Champion.

2134
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,810
Oh, yeah, you have to fight me first.

2135
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:29,520
Please just go easy on me though. 
It's my first time here.

2136
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,090
Okay, I guess I'm not fighting the Champion.

2137
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:34,490
First, I have to fight a Parkour Pro?

2138
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:37,190
This is really weird. I've never even fought a Pro.

2139
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:39,190
What jumps can they even do? I forgot.

2140
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:42,660
For my first attack, I attacked 
with a three-block vertical jump.

2141
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:45,200
I didn't wanna do anything 
too crazy on my first attack,

2142
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:49,590
because if I missed and let him get the chance 
to attack, I run the risk of taking damage.

2143
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:52,650
But fortunately, it seemed like this fight 
was gonna be easier than I thought,

2144
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:53,960
until something happened.

2145
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,910
The blocks that I used for my attack all disappeared.

2146
01:27:56,910 --> 01:28:00,230
In the Parkour Arena, if you place blocks, 
you will never get them back.

2147
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:02,910
And now I realized why I was fighting a Parkour Pro.

2148
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:04,280
It was genius, actually.

2149
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:08,800
If I wasted all of my blocks before getting 
to the Champion, I would have no fighting chance.

2150
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,240
Hey, uh, quick question.

2151
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,990
The people who put you here, 
what did they say you were here for?

2152
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:16,840
Oh, yeah, they said I would be warming up 
the crowd, you know, for like the fight.

2153
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,480
Warming up the crowd?

2154
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,850
Uh, you know, there's literally 
no one watching, right?

2155
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:21,990
Yeah, I know.

2156
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:23,230
Please just get this over with.

2157
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:25,140
Oh, god, I'm a terrible person.

2158
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:27,400
Man, this is the weirdest parkour battle ever.

2159
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:31,820
For my second attack, I built a four-block jump, 
and of course, it was successful once again.

2160
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:33,810
But at this point, I wasn't worried about winning.

2161
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:36,620
I was worried about the blocks 
I was losing for every attack.

2162
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:39,760
There was no way I could afford to use 
more than two blocks for an attack,

2163
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:40,890
at least not in this fight.

2164
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:43,160
For the final attack, I did a backwards jump.

2165
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,680
Did you just go backwards?

2166
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:45,820
This is not gonna be pretty.

2167
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:46,770
Oh, shoot!

2168
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:49,530
Oh, that was not how I thought 
it was gonna turn out.

2169
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:53,020
It was a little unfortunate 
that I essentially wasted two blocks on that jump,

2170
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:55,740
since he didn't even try it, but at least I survived

2171
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:58,010
the first parkour battle without taking any damage.

2172
01:28:58,010 --> 01:28:59,520
So now what happens?

2173
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,770
Do I fight the Champion?

2174
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:03,010
I stood there on the platform 
not knowing what to do,

2175
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:04,810
until I saw someone jumping towards me.

2176
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:05,900
All right, this is it.

2177
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:07,840
This is the battle for life or death.

2178
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,760
Let's get this over with.

2179
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,720
So you must be the Champion, right?

2180
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,170
Me? The Champion?

2181
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:13,290
You're joking, right?

2182
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:15,200
Look at my boots. I'm a Master.

2183
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,250
Do these look diamond to you?

2184
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,300
Okay, well, I don't know.

2185
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,520
I thought it was fighting the Champion.

2186
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,640
So when does that happen?

2187
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,670
You still have two more people to go through 
if you wanna see the Champion,

2188
01:29:22,670 --> 01:29:24,150
but you're not making it past me.

2189
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,550
Let's go, start the battle.

2190
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:26,550
This is not good.

2191
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:30,030
I have to win two more parkour battles 
if I wanna see the Champion,

2192
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:32,270
It was clear that the odds were stacked against me,

2193
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:34,090
but that wasn't gonna stop me from trying.

2194
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:36,080
Now, I was fighting against a Master.

2195
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,390
This means I couldn't hold back with my attacks.

2196
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:40,490
I was gonna have to attack with harder jumps.

2197
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:43,520
I decided this was a good time 
to use one of my stairs.

2198
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,800
For my first attack, I did a four-block 
diagonal stair jump, but I was in trouble.

2199
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:50,260
Even for myself, I knew the attack was too easy.

2200
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:52,210
Ha ha, that's what you're attacking me with?

2201
01:29:52,210 --> 01:29:55,240
I was getting ready for the Master 
to easily defend my attack,

2202
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,160
but by some miracle, he failed it.

2203
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:57,680
What?

2204
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:00,750
The Master didn't know, 
but I realized he built the jump wrong.

2205
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:03,200
He tried doing a harder jump than my attack.

2206
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,290
I got lucky with that first attack, 
but that wasn't gonna happen again.

2207
01:30:06,290 --> 01:30:07,850
I needed to do harder jumps.

2208
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:11,840
I used two more of my stairs 
to build another four-block diagonal jump.

2209
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,900
If I make this, I would only need 
one more attack to win the battle.

2210
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:15,710
But I missed.

2211
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:18,320
I came so close, but I didn't land on the stair.

2212
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,040
Ha, ha, wasted another two stairs, I see.

2213
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,550
Even if you do beat me, you'll have no blocks 
to fight the Champion with.

2214
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:27,280
The Master was right.
 I was running out of blocks quickly.

2215
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:31,270
I only had one stair left, 
and I wasn't even done with my second battle.

2216
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:33,740
I watched as the Master built his first attack.

2217
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:37,140
I was gonna have to defend myself against 
a four-block ice jump.

2218
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:37,690
Go on.

2219
01:30:37,690 --> 01:30:39,070
Use some of your ice blocks.

2220
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:40,570
I'm sure you don't have that many of them.

2221
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:41,250
He was right.

2222
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:43,040
I only had four ice blocks with me.

2223
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:47,480
Even the best case scenario where I defend 
this attack, I'll only have two ice blocks left.

2224
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,890
I went for the jump and I almost slid off,

2225
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:50,940
but I stayed on.

2226
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:52,340
Oh, that was too close.

2227
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:52,970
Okay.

2228
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:56,240
It was now my turn to attack, 
but this battle was taking too long.

2229
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,540
I knew what the Master was doing.

2230
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,950
He was trying to make me waste all of my blocks,

2231
01:30:59,950 --> 01:31:03,770
but there was no way I could let that happen, 
which means I could only do one thing.

2232
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:07,050
I needed to build an attack 
that would end this battle right now.

2233
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:08,720
And I knew just the way to do it.

2234
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:12,390
In a parkour battle, the harder the attack is, 
the more damage it does.

2235
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:16,670
And I was about to attack with one of 
the hardest parkour combos I've ever done.

2236
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:18,990
All right, four-block jump into a two-block.

2237
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:19,850
Let's do this.

2238
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:22,590
I attacked with a four-block jump into a 360.

2239
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:23,350
And I made it.

2240
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:24,520
Haha, let's go!

2241
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,700
I actually made it!

2242
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:28,050
That was the craziest 
parkour combo I've ever done.

2243
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:31,770
Alright, buddy, your turn, 
four-block jump into a two-block 360.

2244
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:32,830
This is impossible!

2245
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:36,160
I watched as the Parkour Master 
attempted the combo and failed,

2246
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:39,160
and the damage was enough 
to win the parkour battle.

2247
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,280
It- it worked!

2248
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:44,360
That parkour combo that I did may have 
just saved my life, at least for now.

2249
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:47,610
If that Master was telling the truth, 
I still have to win one more battle

2250
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:48,980
if I wanna fight the Champion.

2251
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,390
There was nothing else I could do.

2252
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:53,740
I tried looking around for a way to escape, 
but there was nowhere I could go.

2253
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:56,710
The only way out of this arena 
is to continue fighting.

2254
01:31:56,710 --> 01:32:00,900
From across the arena, the path opened up 
and my third opponent jumped towards me.

2255
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:01,720
Evbo.

2256
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,810
You've come so far, but this is as far as you go.

2257
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:07,750
I'm afraid you won't make it past me 
to fight the Champion.

2258
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:08,700
Let's begin.

2259
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:11,170
Okay, let's do this. It's just another Master.

2260
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:13,320
I just beat one before, and I can do it again.

2261
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,950
If I could finish this battle 
with a couple parkour combos,

2262
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:18,260
I might have enough blocks to fight the Champion.

2263
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:21,390
For my first attack, I decided 
to build two four-block jumps.

2264
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:24,780
I thought this combo would be hard, 
but I had no clue who I was facing.

2265
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:28,410
The Master made the jumps easily, 
and my attack was unsuccessful.

2266
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,020
Now I was in huge trouble.

2267
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:32,710
Unlike all the other people 
I faced in parkour battles,

2268
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:36,080
this Master was not afraid to attack 
with his own parkour combos.

2269
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:39,750
And unfortunately for me, 
his was much harder than mine.

2270
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:43,480
The second jump in the combo was a jump 
that I didn't think would be possible.

2271
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,510
It was too far. But I had to try.

2272
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:47,160
My life depended on this.

2273
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,310
I went to defend the attack, but I overjumped it.

2274
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:52,470
The attack dealt five hearts of damage.

2275
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:54,620
Oh, this is not good. This is really not good.

2276
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:57,780
I managed to gain back two hearts, 
but my hunger was lost.

2277
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:58,430
This was it.

2278
01:32:58,430 --> 01:32:59,700
No more second chances.

2279
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,280
No more regenerating health.

2280
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,740
I had to make these jumps.

2281
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:05,430
The Parkour Master attacked 
with an even harder combo,

2282
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:07,740
this time using two chains and an ice block.

2283
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:09,460
But by some miracle, I made it.

2284
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:11,610
Oh man, how did I just do that?

2285
01:33:11,610 --> 01:33:12,740
This Master was too good.

2286
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:15,520
No matter what jump I thought of, 
I knew he could make it.

2287
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,760
That's why I was gonna have to 
do something that's never been done

2288
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,650
in the history of parkour battles.

2289
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:23,340
And I was gonna have to do this first try.

2290
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:25,480
Finish it off with the three-block candle jump.

2291
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:26,890
And we are done.

2292
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:27,560
Let's go!

2293
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,610
I'm probably gonna die. Let's do this.

2294
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:31,030
Flower Pot jump to chain,

2295
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:33,610
chain backwards jump, to 360 fence jump,

2296
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:35,370
diagonal chain jump to the candle!

2297
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:37,050
I... I- I did it.

2298
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:40,850
I just made the hardest parkour combo in the world.

2299
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:44,580
Evbo, the Champion tasked me 
with making sure you don't rank up,

2300
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:46,770
but I now realize that's not possible.

2301
01:33:46,770 --> 01:33:49,850
Your parkour is beyond me. You have my respects.

2302
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:51,380
Good luck against the Champion.

2303
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:55,090
Before I could say anything, 
the Master gave up and just jumped off.

2304
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:59,770
I won the third battle, which means 
now I only have to battle the Champion.

2305
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:04,550
And the Champion is the one that tried to stop me 
from ranking up this entire time?

2306
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:06,710
Hahahahahahaha!

2307
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:11,380
All of this parkour, just to die by the Champion.

2308
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:16,020
This was it. Standing in front of me was 
the Champion of Parkour Civilization.

2309
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:18,150
You put up a good fight, I'll give you that.

2310
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:19,800
But this ends here.

2311
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:25,500
I watched as the Parkour Champion built his 
first attack, and it was a five-block jump.

2312
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:29,160
If you beat me in this battle, 
you become the Parkour Champion,

2313
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:32,160
and <i>you</i> could be the one that makes the rules.

2314
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:34,410
But this is my Parkour Civilization,

2315
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:37,540
and I. Never. Lose.

2316
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:40,560
The Parkour Champion made the five-block jump.

2317
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:41,500
It's not possible.

2318
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,740
It's just... not.

2319
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:44,170
I... I can't do it.

2320
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:45,800
This was it. This was the end.

2321
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:50,230
There was no second chance, no backup 
I could call for, nothing to get me out of this.

2322
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:54,620
I lost, and I won't be the one 
to save Parkour Civilization.

2323
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:00,300
I opened my eyes and I was in a place 
that I knew all too well.

2324
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:02,140
I was down at the bottom.

2325
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:05,790
I was in the Parkour Temple 
at the Noob level of Parkour Civilization.

2326
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:08,580
I opened my inventory and I had leather boots on.

2327
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:12,250
After the battle with the Champion, 
I... am now a Noob again.

2328
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:13,970
I let everyone down.

2329
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:17,980
I was supposed to be the one 
to save Parkour Civilization, and I couldn't do it.

2330
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:20,200
And now the Champion gets what he wants.

2331
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:22,500
No one can ever rank up ever again.

2332
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:23,450
No one's free.

2333
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:26,330
People risked their lives 
because they trusted me to help them

2334
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:28,450
and I failed, and it was all for nothing.

2335
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:30,450
Now, I'm just at the bottom again.

2336
01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:34,180
I don't even have sprint. 
I can't even do more than a two-block jump.

2337
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:34,990
It's over, right?

2338
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:39,760
The old man gave me the last ticket to rank up, 
and even if I did, what's the point?

2339
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,440
The only way I could save people 
is by becoming the Champion

2340
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,440
and he's impossible to beat.

2341
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:48,070
Oh, well, it's out of my hands now. 
There's nothing to do.

2342
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:50,880
I mean, maybe I just go back to Parkour Prison.

2343
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:55,320
At least there, I could get fed some better food. 
Rather have fish than raw chicken.

2344
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,230
Down at the bottom again, are we?

2345
01:35:57,230 --> 01:35:57,870
What?

2346
01:35:57,870 --> 01:35:59,700
Maybe I was wrong about you.

2347
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:01,040
You were wrong about me?

2348
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,220
Wait, who are you?

2349
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:04,910
Something tells me you already know the answer.

2350
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:09,580
The strange man turned around, 
and he was wearing... Netherite boots?

2351
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:11,730
<i>Oh, I do not wanna do that again.</i>

2352
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:13,880
<i>There must be a parkour god looking out for me.</i>

2353
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:18,080
You're the Parkour God? But you were just a myth!

2354
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,010
Is this all of your doing?

2355
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:23,960
The Parkour Civilization I created 
was never intended to divide people,

2356
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:26,740
but the new Champion had different plans.

2357
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:30,580
And you, you wanted me to stop 
the Champion, and I couldn't.

2358
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:32,270
I'm sorry you put your trust in me.

2359
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:34,550
I thought I was good enough. I thought I could do it.

2360
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:36,810
You seem like all hope is lost.

2361
01:36:36,810 --> 01:36:38,800
I mean, I- I can't do anything.

2362
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,280
I'm back at the Noob level.

2363
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,910
I can't get a ticket anymore. I can't even sprint.

2364
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:46,260
What good is a one-block jump gonna 
do against the Parkour Champion?

2365
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:50,100
As long as you can parkour, there is always a way.

2366
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:53,540
The Parkour God dropped a pair of boots 
on the ground and jumped away.

2367
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:54,820
What is going on?

2368
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:57,720
I jumped over and grabbed the boots 
that the Parkour God left.

2369
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:59,340
These were no ordinary boots.

2370
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:00,570
These were diamond.

2371
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:02,700
Only the Parkour Champion wears these.

2372
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,680
And now I have them.

2373
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:08,290
I threw away my leather boots 
and I put on the Champion boots.

2374
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:12,890
Immediately, my hunger bar returned to full 
and I could see above into the upper layers.

2375
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:13,810
Oh my god.

2376
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:16,080
This is crazy. What is going on? What is going on?

2377
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,400
I don't know where 
the Parkour God got these boots from

2378
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,120
or why he would trust <i>me</i> with them.

2379
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:20,960
But it didn't matter.

2380
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,610
This was my second chance.

2381
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:25,780
I don't know how I'm gonna get back up 
to the top, but I'm gonna find a way.

2382
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:27,580
Everyone's life depends on this,

2383
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:31,080
and that's why I'm gonna be the one 
to save Parkour Civilization.

2384
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:33,510
Parkour Civilization was in danger.

2385
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:38,420
I thought people could parkour their way up 
to a better life, but I realized it was all just a lie.

2386
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:42,680
The truth is that the Parkour Champion 
controls everyone and everything.

2387
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:47,350
I thought I could be the one to put an end to it 
and save everyone, but I failed.

2388
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:50,740
Luckily for me, second chances 
come around quite often,

2389
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:54,380
and I still have one more shot 
at saving Parkour Civilization.

2390
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:57,770
The only way I can put an end to all this is 
if I beat the Parkour Champion,

2391
01:37:57,770 --> 01:38:00,740
and that means I have to 
get back up to the arena somehow.

2392
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:02,580
And that was gonna be harder than I thought.

2393
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:06,760
I had diamond boots on, meaning the barriers 
to the Parkour Temple shouldn't be here,

2394
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:09,130
but they were, and I had no way up.

2395
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:11,540
That means somehow 
I was gonna have to get a ticket.

2396
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:12,710
Oh, this is not good.

2397
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:15,850
I can't even earn a ticket myself, 
meaning the only way I'm gonna get one

2398
01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:17,630
is if some other Noob has one.

2399
01:38:17,630 --> 01:38:22,310
But even if I got lucky and a Noob hasn't used 
their ticket already, I couldn't find anyone.

2400
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:25,720
I was beginning to think that there were Noobs left 
and they were all in prison

2401
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,970
until I finally found one still standing.

2402
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:31,100
I asked the Noob if there was 
any chance he had a ticket or even

2403
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:33,400
knew someone with a ticket so 
I could get into the Temple.

2404
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:37,600
But he said that Pros don't come down 
here anymore and do ticket challenges.

2405
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,800
It's now impossible 
for Parkour Noobs to rank up at all.

2406
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,770
This has to be the Champion's doing.

2407
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:46,680
If Pros don't come down here at all, 
the Noobs have no way of getting food.

2408
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:49,820
That means if I don't get up in time 
and beat the Champion,

2409
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:51,260
everyone down here will die.

2410
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:53,690
There has to be a way I can get past these barriers.

2411
01:38:53,690 --> 01:38:57,490
I mean, the parkour God wouldn't have 
given me Champion boots for nothing, right?

2412
01:38:57,490 --> 01:38:58,630
And that's when I remembered.

2413
01:38:58,630 --> 01:39:00,780
I had Champion boots on now.

2414
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:04,070
These boots were meant for the person 
that rules Parkour Civilization.

2415
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:06,480
And that's when I thought back 
to what the Champion said.

2416
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:10,180
<i>If you beat me in this battle, 
you become the Parkour Champion.</i>

2417
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:13,020
<i>And </i>you<i> could be the one that makes the rules.</i>

2418
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:15,250
If the Parkour Champion makes the rules,

2419
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:17,660
they had to be the one to place the barriers, right?

2420
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:20,440
Which means if someone placed them, 
someone can get rid of them.

2421
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:22,950
It was a shot in the dark, 
but I thought I'd at least try.

2422
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:25,260
Ugh, this is pointless. This is not gonna work.

2423
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:26,200
Wait, what?

2424
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,330
It- It broke.

2425
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:29,130
I couldn't believe it, but there it was.

2426
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:31,140
I was staring at a hole in the barriers.

2427
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:33,770
This is insane! I can break barriers now?

2428
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:36,520
Oh, thank you, Parkour God. Let's go!

2429
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:40,300
I got rid of more of the barriers 
until there was a space big enough to jump through.

2430
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:43,140
All right, let me make sure 
I'm not hitting my head on any of these.

2431
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:45,250
And now, it's time to go save everyone.

2432
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:45,790
I did it.

2433
01:39:45,790 --> 01:39:49,280
I was now inside the Parkour Temple 
and I was one step closer

2434
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:50,830
to getting back up to the top.

2435
01:39:50,830 --> 01:39:54,230
Now that I was in the Temple, 
it was time to start actually coming up with a plan.

2436
01:39:54,230 --> 01:39:57,330
I was gonna have to find a way 
to somehow get back into the arena

2437
01:39:57,330 --> 01:39:58,390
and fight the Champion.

2438
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:01,740
And even if I do manage to do that, 
I still have to worry about beating him,

2439
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,050
which is a whole other story.

2440
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:05,650
My rough draft of a plan involved grabbing blocks,

2441
01:40:05,650 --> 01:40:08,450
and I thought I could get some here, 
but the chests were empty.

2442
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:12,520
Those chests were usually filled with 
blocks for the Pros to do their daily tasks,

2443
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,300
but someone got rid of all of them.

2444
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:17,230
My idea of getting blocks 
was already off to a bad start,

2445
01:40:17,230 --> 01:40:20,010
but I had a backup plan 
for where I could go to get more.

2446
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:22,870
I made it back up to the second 
layer of Parkour Civilization,

2447
01:40:22,870 --> 01:40:24,740
but now was no time to celebrate.

2448
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:29,020
I still had such a long way to go to get up 
to the third layer and time was running out.

2449
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:32,270
I made my way over to the place 
where I could get all the blocks I needed.

2450
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:35,450
The Parkour Training Grounds should 
have thousands of blocks I could use.

2451
01:40:35,450 --> 01:40:39,340
The last time I was in here, 
I was training to rank up to become a Master.

2452
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:40,460
But something was off.

2453
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:43,760
The course I built to practice 
to rank up was still here.

2454
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,040
This doesn't make sense.

2455
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:48,040
Have all of the Pros just been 
practicing this course I built?

2456
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:50,580
But that's when my situation 
just got a whole lot worse.

2457
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:52,520
No, no, no, come on, they can't be empty.

2458
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,260
Why are they empty?

2459
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:55,800
All of these chests should 
have been filled with blocks

2460
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,900
to build parkour jumps, but they were all empty.

2461
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:00,190
Okay, this is not good. This is really not good.

2462
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:03,380
Something strange was going on, 
and I needed to find some answers.

2463
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:06,540
I took a trip back to where I used to live 
when I was a Parkour Pro.

2464
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:09,690
If there was anyone I could trust to talk to, 
it would be my neighbor.

2465
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:11,930
And that was assuming he was still alive.

2466
01:41:11,930 --> 01:41:14,810
I found the house where my neighbor 
used to live, and thankfully,

2467
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:17,470
Parkour Civilization hadn't claimed him just yet.

2468
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:19,510
Evbo, you're alive!

2469
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:22,130
And you're the... Parkour Champion?

2470
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:23,930
Well, I'm not really the Champion?

2471
01:41:23,930 --> 01:41:25,390
I mean, I guess technically I am?

2472
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:26,540
I don't know. It's a long story.

2473
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:29,900
I asked my neighbor what was going on, 
and he said everything has changed.

2474
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:33,350
He said that Parkour Pros aren't allowed to 
go down to the Noob level anymore,

2475
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:35,860
and some Masters came down and took every block,

2476
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:37,440
and they can't even practice anymore.

2477
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,150
This was it.

2478
01:41:38,150 --> 01:41:40,880
This was truly the end of Parkour Civilization.

2479
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,410
First, it was the Noobs in danger.

2480
01:41:42,410 --> 01:41:45,580
Now the Pros are, and soon, 
it might even be the Masters.

2481
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:49,890
One by one, the Parkour Champion 
is taking away the free will of everyone.

2482
01:41:49,890 --> 01:41:53,070
And if I don't end this now, 
there will be no one left to oppose him.

2483
01:41:53,070 --> 01:41:54,240
All right, no pressure.

2484
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:57,010
The fate of the world is in my hands, 
and now I have to speedrun

2485
01:41:57,010 --> 01:41:59,030
one of the hardest parkour courses there is.

2486
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:03,000
Unlike getting up to the Pro level, 
there was no easy way up to the Master level.

2487
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,330
If you wanted to get back, you had to do the course.

2488
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:07,880
Even though I've made this 
course before, this was different.

2489
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:08,810
Time was running out,

2490
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:11,530
meaning I couldn't waste any 
taking this parkour course slow.

2491
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:14,960
And I can't afford to miss a single jump, 
because if I do, well,

2492
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,150
then I guess the Parkour God 
trusted the wrong person.

2493
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:20,280
Luckily, I made the course 
and I was now at the Master level.

2494
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:23,530
And now I was at one part 
of my master plan, which, well,

2495
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:25,250
has not been going to plan at all.

2496
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:27,770
If I don't get these gold boots... Okay, thank you!

2497
01:42:27,770 --> 01:42:29,750
Finally something goes according to my plan.

2498
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:33,170
I didn't know if I would still get Master boots 
if I had Champion boots on,

2499
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:34,820
but luckily, I got an extra pair.

2500
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:37,420
Now that I was on the Master 
level, I had to blend in.

2501
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:39,950
Any one of these Masters could 
be working for the Champion,

2502
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:42,350
and if they saw me with Champion boots on, well,

2503
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:44,750
that's attention that 
I definitely do not want right now.

2504
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:47,710
At least with the gold boots on, 
the people working for the Champion

2505
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:48,960
might not recognize me.

2506
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,810
Now was the next part of my plan.

2507
01:42:50,810 --> 01:42:53,400
If I have any shot at all 
of getting back into the arena,

2508
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:56,060
I was gonna need the Parkour 
Master that saved my life.

2509
01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:58,700
But when I went into 
the secret room in the Parkour Temple,

2510
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:00,080
he was nowhere to be found.

2511
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:04,200
Of course, I knew it was too good to be true 
to have two things in my plan go smoothly.

2512
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:05,720
Now I gotta improvise.

2513
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:08,440
Now, I had to figure out 
where the Parkour Master lived,

2514
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,520
and I had no way of knowing which house he had.

2515
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:13,290
The only thing I could do is sit 
and wait for him to show up,

2516
01:43:13,290 --> 01:43:15,440
but if I stayed down here, I run the risk of

2517
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,650
the Masters on the Champion's side finding me.

2518
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:20,200
I needed somewhere that would 
at least buy me a little more time,

2519
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:24,700
and the only place I thought of was to wait 
at the very top of the parkour staircase.

2520
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:28,110
At least here, I won't be seen that easily, 
but if I had to get down fast,

2521
01:43:28,110 --> 01:43:30,050
I had no water bucket to save me.

2522
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:32,940
I realized I was standing so close 
to the barrier between

2523
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:36,580
the Master and the Champion levels, 
and now I have Champion boots,

2524
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:40,010
meaning if I put these on, will I'd be able to see

2525
01:43:40,010 --> 01:43:42,020
what life is like at the Champion level?

2526
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:45,450
But before I could put them on, 
I saw the Parkour Master I was looking for.

2527
01:43:45,450 --> 01:43:48,170
Now this is the part I was not looking forward to.

2528
01:43:48,170 --> 01:43:51,850
The only way I can follow 
the Parkour Master is by taking fall damage.

2529
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:54,450
And I'm just hoping that the drop 
to his house isn't too far.

2530
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:56,420
And of course it's a 50 block drop.

2531
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:57,460
I'm never surviving that.

2532
01:43:57,460 --> 01:44:00,390
Oh man, I have an idea and I don't like it.

2533
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:02,850
Yep, this is officially the worst idea I've ever had.

2534
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:04,940
Okay, no more thinking. Let's just do this.

2535
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:06,620
I got momentum and I jumped.

2536
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:08,640
I thought it was too short, but I made it.

2537
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:09,920
Oh, that was so crazy.

2538
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,320
I know the Parkour God does 
not like me for that one.

2539
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:16,140
Even though I barely survived, I found the Parkour Master without being caught.

2540
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:19,850
And now it was time to carry out my plan 
to save Parkour Civilization.

2541
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:22,070
I told the Master everything that happened

2542
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:24,140
and I showed him that I had Champion boots.

2543
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:27,300
I told him that if I was gonna beat 
the Champion, I would need his help.

2544
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:31,000
I can't believe you survived 
and you met the Parkour God.

2545
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,700
We can actually save everyone.

2546
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:34,840
Just tell me what I need to do and I'll do it.

2547
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:37,410
I had the Master give me some blocks and I told him

2548
01:44:37,410 --> 01:44:39,130
to wait here for the next part of my plan.

2549
01:44:39,130 --> 01:44:42,020
If everything goes right, 
I should have everything I need

2550
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:45,050
to get back into the arena 
and defeat the Parkour Champion.

2551
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:49,040
But that's assuming everything goes right 
and so far it hasn't worked out that way.

2552
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:51,150
I jumped over to the Parkour Bank.

2553
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:55,340
To get back into the arena, I was gonna need 
more difficult blocks to build parkour with.

2554
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:56,850
And I think I know how to get some.

2555
01:44:56,850 --> 01:45:00,360
Hey man, I don't mean to assume anything, 
but the top floor is for people with money.

2556
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,120
You can come back when you're rich though.

2557
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:05,360
Upstairs must be the place 
where the bank keeps their harder blocks.

2558
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,210
Sir, you're not allowed to go up there.

2559
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:08,930
Sorry, man. Got a bank to ro—

2560
01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:10,300
Okay, never mind.

2561
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:13,780
I was expecting to see places 
where I could buy flower pots and candles,

2562
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:17,020
but instead, there was just 
a massive box with a door.

2563
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:20,550
Sir, this is a private vault 
for one of our most valuable customers.

2564
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:22,000
You have to leave immediately.

2565
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,440
A private vault?

2566
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:24,700
I guess that might work.

2567
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:26,300
You're not getting into this vault.

2568
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,600
No amount of money could make me open this door.

2569
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:29,460
No amount of money?

2570
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:32,670
Man, this guy clearly has never 
heard of one of my bribes before.

2571
01:45:32,670 --> 01:45:34,240
Just stop. It's not even worth i—

2572
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:34,720
What?

2573
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,160
What do you say you open the door now?

2574
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:38,750
I take it you don't see it backwards 360 too often.

2575
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:40,560
Okay, well, I have to let you in now.

2576
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,980
Let's go! I still got it.

2577
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:43,450
Please just don't take anything.

2578
01:45:43,450 --> 01:45:45,680
Yeah, I'm definitely not listening to that.

2579
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:48,220
I started looking around the vault 
for anything I could use,

2580
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:52,120
but most of the chests were empty 
until I finally stumbled upon a water bucket.

2581
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:55,040
Okay, I need blocks, but I guess I'll take this.

2582
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:55,690
I don't get it.

2583
01:45:55,690 --> 01:45:59,820
Whoever owns this vault is supposedly rich, 
and the only thing I found is a water bucket.

2584
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:01,820
And 16 blocks, never mind.

2585
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:04,320
I thought this vault was a dead end until it wasn't.

2586
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:07,270
In the last barrel, I found 16 brewing stands.

2587
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:09,400
Now, my plan could actually work.

2588
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:11,930
It was time to go defeat the Parkour Champion.

2589
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:15,250
Uh, sir, I just wanted to let you 
know someone got into your vault.

2590
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:19,180
You're the only one who has access to it, 
so explain to me how that happened.

2591
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:23,620
I mean, I'm sorry, sir, but he bribed me 
with a backwards 360. I had to.

2592
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,580
A backwards 360?

2593
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:27,290
There's no one that can do a—

2594
01:46:27,290 --> 01:46:29,820
No, NO. How is this possible?

2595
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:33,300
You know, someone told me something interesting 
about brewing stand jumps.

2596
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:36,850
They're not just difficult, 
but they can deal any potion effect you want.

2597
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:39,620
That's why I wish you 
the best of luck in this parkour battle

2598
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:42,840
Because if you don't make this jump, 
you're getting the slowness effect.

2599
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:46,150
I watched as Seawatt tried 
to defend my attack, but he failed.

2600
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:48,120
All right, now it's time for some answers.

2601
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:50,640
I need you to tell me how 
to beat the Parkour Champion.

2602
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:52,950
You're crazy if you think I'm telling you that.

2603
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:54,280
Yep, I thought you might say that.

2604
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:56,270
Let's see, three-block, oh, that's plenty.

2605
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:58,730
All right, one more chance to tell me, 
unless you wanna defend

2606
01:46:58,730 --> 01:47:00,010
another one of my attacks.

2607
01:47:00,010 --> 01:47:02,480
I think I can handle a three-block.

2608
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:05,590
All right, man, if you think you can make this jump 
with slowness, be my guest.

2609
01:47:05,590 --> 01:47:07,880
I'm just gonna let you know 
now that it's not possible,

2610
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,840
so in a couple jumps, you'll lose everything.

2611
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,590
Okay, wait, don't! I'll tell you.

2612
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:13,380
Please, I like my life here.

2613
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:14,510
Well, that was easy.

2614
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:17,280
Ugh, I can't believe I'm telling you this.

2615
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,730
The Champion uses barrier blocks to parkour.

2616
01:47:19,730 --> 01:47:21,990
He's the only one that has any left.

2617
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:24,640
He built his parkour jumps with barriers.

2618
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:25,950
That means I was right.

2619
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:27,760
The five block jump <i>was</i> impossible.

2620
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:29,290
He just used a barrier.

2621
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:33,540
Okay, wait, so if he uses barriers for his attacks, 
how do I defend against that?

2622
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:36,510
Dude, if the Parkour Champion finds out about this,

2623
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:37,770
I'm gonna lose everything.

2624
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:39,350
I don't care. Just tell me.

2625
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:40,730
Fine. Ugh.

2626
01:47:40,730 --> 01:47:42,910
There's a secret rule in parkour battles that says

2627
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:45,460
if you build a harder jump 
than an opponent's attack,

2628
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:47,720
your opponent will have to do that jump instead.

2629
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:49,130
That's how I beat him.

2630
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:51,590
I can just attack with a harder jump.

2631
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:55,500
Even if he does use barriers for his attacks, 
I just have to build better ones.

2632
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,030
Oh man, this is crazy.

2633
01:47:57,030 --> 01:47:57,820
All right, let's do this.

2634
01:47:57,820 --> 01:48:00,530
You need to send me back 
to the arena like you did before.

2635
01:48:00,530 --> 01:48:02,600
And this time, I'm only fighting the Champion.

2636
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:07,040
Heheh, okay, so if you let me attack you, 
what's stopping me from just

2637
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,840
getting rid of you once and for all?

2638
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:10,360
Yeah, I thought you might say that.

2639
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:13,380
That's why I got one of the 
best Parkour Masters I know

2640
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:15,010
to watch you at all times.

2641
01:48:15,010 --> 01:48:18,320
And if he finds out I don't make it 
into the arena, haha,

2642
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,160
let's just say you won't see 
the attack coming before it hits you.

2643
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:23,340
Oh man, how do you even do these jumps?

2644
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:25,020
I really hope Evbo's plan works.

2645
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:26,480
There's no way I can make one of these.

2646
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:29,460
Just as I thought, Seawatt had 
no choice but to listen to me.

2647
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:32,770
Now, all that I was hoping for is 
that I would wake up in the arena.

2648
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:35,580
I knew Seawatt couldn't be trusted, 
but I had no choice.

2649
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:39,390
This was the only way I could get back 
into the arena, and luckily, it worked.

2650
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:43,570
Now, I could battle the Parkour Champion, 
and this time, it was gonna be different.

2651
01:48:43,570 --> 01:48:47,190
I got all of the blocks I needed 
and I made my way into the arena.

2652
01:48:47,190 --> 01:48:50,830
Now, it was time to see if Seawatt 
was gonna uphold his end of the deal.

2653
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:51,870
But he did.

2654
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:55,950
Standing in front of me was 
the Champion of Parkour Civilization.

2655
01:48:55,950 --> 01:48:57,690
All right, let's go save everyone.

2656
01:48:57,690 --> 01:48:59,040
Hahahahaha.

2657
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:02,260
I should have known the old 
man would give his boots to you.

2658
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:04,300
What? The old man?

2659
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:05,260
Doesn't matter.

2660
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:08,850
You can try as many times as you want, 
but your fate remains the same.

2661
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:12,240
The Parkour God didn't just 
give me random Champion boots.

2662
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:13,880
He gave me the old man's.

2663
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:16,040
He was the old Parkour Champion.

2664
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,980
Okay, this is a lot to think about right now.

2665
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:19,830
I just got to worry about defending this attack.

2666
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:21,380
Well, Seawatt got me this far,

2667
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:23,850
but now it's time to see 
if he was really telling the truth.

2668
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:27,390
The Champion's attack was technically only 
a four-block jump with a barrier.

2669
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:30,240
So the parkour combo I was 
about to do should be harder.

2670
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:34,070
I countered with a three-block 360 
to a three-block fence jump.

2671
01:49:34,070 --> 01:49:34,720
What?

2672
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:38,340
The Parkour Champion looked confused, 
and suddenly his attack disappeared.

2673
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:40,160
It worked! It actually worked!

2674
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:42,480
The secret rule Seawatt told me about was real.

2675
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:45,760
And now the Champion has no choice 
but to defend <i>my</i> attack.

2676
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:48,560
Except just when I thought I had 
the upper hand in the battle,

2677
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,590
the Champion pulled out barrier blocks.

2678
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:55,060
Instead of building my jump, 
the Champion built some invisible parkour combo.

2679
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:57,690
The barriers were invisible, 
and I had no way of knowing

2680
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:59,530
what sort of parkour combo he built.

2681
01:49:59,530 --> 01:50:03,790
But whatever it was, it was better than my attack, 
and my attack was now erased.

2682
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:07,650
That only left me with one choice, 
and I would have to build something even harder.

2683
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:11,750
I didn't even know what the Champion built, 
so I couldn't hold back on this next attack.

2684
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:13,050
I knew I had to risk it all.

2685
01:50:13,050 --> 01:50:15,850
I pulled out a 180 vertical flower pot jump

2686
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:19,220
into a backwards 360 candle jump, and I made it.

2687
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:21,220
The Parkour Champion's attack was erased,

2688
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:25,070
and he had no choice but 
to either try my attack or build a harder one.

2689
01:50:25,070 --> 01:50:28,520
But the Parkour Champion wasn't phased 
and he countered my attack

2690
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:31,440
with the hardest known jumps 
in Parkour Civilization.

2691
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:34,800
These were neo jumps, and he did two in a row.

2692
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,870
Jumps where you have to 
jump around a block in midair.

2693
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:41,050
I knew I couldn't do these jumps 
and this was not the time to try them.

2694
01:50:41,050 --> 01:50:43,230
But the Parkour Champion set the bar high,

2695
01:50:43,230 --> 01:50:47,210
meaning if my next attack isn't harder 
than his, I lose everything.

2696
01:50:47,210 --> 01:50:51,270
But if I don't make this jump I'm about to build, 
my entire journey is over.

2697
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:54,330
But that means the same goes 
for the Parkour Champion.

2698
01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:57,110
Any one of these attacks 
will do more than 10 hearts.

2699
01:50:57,110 --> 01:50:58,940
That means I have to make this.

2700
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:02,370
The Parkour God trusted me 
with these boots to save everyone.

2701
01:51:02,370 --> 01:51:06,590
And for the first time in my life, 
I actually felt like I was worthy of them,

2702
01:51:06,590 --> 01:51:09,350
that I was worthy of being the Parkour Champion.

2703
01:51:09,350 --> 01:51:10,050
What?

2704
01:51:10,050 --> 01:51:11,750
This shouldn't be happening!

2705
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:15,120
I thought I had bested 
the Parkour Champion, but I was wrong.

2706
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:16,520
This ends NOW.

2707
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:21,340
The Parkour Champion built an attack 
that was directly over the void.

2708
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:24,440
Either you go down or we <i>both</i> go down.

2709
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:25,750
This was the end.

2710
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:28,160
The Parkour Champion knew he lost the battle,

2711
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:31,330
so he built a jump that would take us both down,

2712
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:33,760
and there's nothing I can do to defend myself.

2713
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:38,410
I knew deep down that this was most likely 
my last jump in Parkour Civilization,

2714
01:51:38,410 --> 01:51:40,600
but this time I wasn't gonna give up.

2715
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:46,490
Parkour God, if you're watching me, 
please, just give me the strength for one last jump.

2716
01:51:50,650 --> 01:51:53,830
I didn't expect my feet to hit 
the ground again, but they did.

2717
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:55,000
And when I turned around,

2718
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,920
the Parkour Champion had fallen.

2719
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,040
I... I won.

2720
01:51:58,040 --> 01:51:59,360
I actually won!

2721
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:00,450
It's over, right?

2722
01:52:00,450 --> 01:52:02,140
I'm the new Parkour Champion.

2723
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:05,930
I'm supposed to be the one who can make 
the rules and save everyone.

2724
01:52:05,930 --> 01:52:08,010
So how do I do that?

2725
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:10,690
But as I was standing there, 
something started to happen.

2726
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:15,670
My items and my inventory were gone 
and I got teleported to the Parkour Temple.

2727
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:20,620
When I walked outside, I looked around, 
and I realized there was nothing above me.

2728
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:23,550
And that's what I remember something 
the Parkour Master said to me.

2729
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:27,250
He told me that the Champion is 
the only one who knows the way up.

2730
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:29,890
I turned around and looked at the Parkour Temple,

2731
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:33,060
and where there was nothing before, 
there was now a way up

2732
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:35,490
to get to the top of Parkour Civilization.

2733
01:52:35,490 --> 01:52:37,840
That means my journey wasn't done yet.

2734
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,650
I still had to make it to the top.

2735
01:52:39,650 --> 01:52:42,790
Luckily, I'm now considered 
the best in Parkour Civilization,

2736
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:45,480
so if there's anyone who can make 
the jumps, it was me.

2737
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:49,030
Only one more set of jumps 
stood between me and the top.

2738
01:52:49,030 --> 01:52:53,180
I had always dreamed of this day 
when I'd look up and I'd see nothing above me.

2739
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:56,680
But I never would've imagined what 
I'd have to go through to get here.

2740
01:52:56,680 --> 01:53:00,860
Every jump I made and every jump 
I failed all led me to this point,

2741
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:04,270
to make it to the top of Parkour Civilization.

2742
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:07,070
And now I was here and there was nothing,

2743
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:09,680
just pure emptiness and only the sky.

2744
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:13,510
I didn't have any idea of what to do 
until I saw a structure in the distance.

2745
01:53:13,510 --> 01:53:17,830
I walked over and I saw blocks I've never seen 
before in Parkour Civilization.

2746
01:53:17,830 --> 01:53:21,720
They were Command Blocks 
and they were placed in front of a throne.

2747
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:25,710
I stepped up onto the throne 
and I got my pair of Champion boots.

2748
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:28,640
But this time they weren't 
someone else's. They were mine.

2749
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:31,760
It only makes sense that 
doing parkour on Command Blocks

2750
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,990
gives me the power to make 
the rules of Parkour Civilization.

2751
01:53:34,990 --> 01:53:38,630
But before I start completely changing 
the entire rules of society,

2752
01:53:38,630 --> 01:53:40,350
I needed to do something first.

2753
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,930
Well, I think it's time I give these back.

2754
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:45,100
I have a feeling you'll probably be needing them.

2755
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:48,010
Evbo, you did it. You saved us.

2756
01:53:48,010 --> 01:53:49,790
No, no, I- I didn't do anything.

2757
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:51,460
It was only possible because of you.

2758
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:53,980
And that's why... I think 
<i>you</i> should be the Champion.

2759
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:56,010
I don't know what to do with Parkour Civilization.

2760
01:53:56,010 --> 01:53:58,920
But you, <i>you</i> were the Champion. 
You know how to fix things.

2761
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:00,820
I just don't think I'm ready to be the—

2762
01:54:00,820 --> 01:54:02,010
Whoa, WOAH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

2763
01:54:02,010 --> 01:54:06,120
Evbo, you think all of this was 
for <i>me</i> to become the Champion again?

2764
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:10,230
I'm old, and you know Parkour Civilization 
better than I ever could.

2765
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:12,650
Well, all right, I'm gonna need your help.

2766
01:54:12,650 --> 01:54:15,190
With every four-block jump 
on the Command Blocks,

2767
01:54:15,190 --> 01:54:17,970
I can change the rules of Parkour Civilization.

2768
01:54:17,970 --> 01:54:19,450
And with the help of the old Champion,

2769
01:54:19,450 --> 01:54:21,930
I'm not just gonna make things go back 
to the way they were.

2770
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:24,010
I'm gonna make things better than they ever were.

2771
01:54:24,010 --> 01:54:27,140
Parkour was never about making or failing a jump.

2772
01:54:27,140 --> 01:54:29,500
It was about getting up and trying again.

2773
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:33,360
The Parkour God told me as long 
as you can parkour, there is always a way.

2774
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:38,070
And in my Parkour Civilization, 
people will <i>always</i> have a chance to try again.

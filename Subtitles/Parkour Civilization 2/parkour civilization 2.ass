Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.67,0:01:21.50,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,and now life is totally different.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.50,0:01:24.41,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,So this is how it works now in my civilization.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.41,0:01:29.44,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Every new player spawns at the bottom level \Nof Parkour Civilization as a Parkour Noob.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.44,0:01:32.48,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,There they will learn \Nhow life works in Parkour Civilization
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.48,0:01:34.32,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,and probably fail their first jumps.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.32,0:01:36.25,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,But even if they do it's okay because
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.25,0:01:38.80,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,they'll just spawn right back inside \Nthe Parkour Temple.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.80,0:01:41.42,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Once a Noob gets more experienced in parkour
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.42,0:01:45.95,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,they can attempt the course to rank up to try \Nto get to the next level of Parkour Civilization.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.95,0:01:48.85,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,And yes, I made sure this course \Nwas actually possible
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.85,0:01:51.72,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,and not some evil way to make sure \Nthat people never ranked up.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.72,0:01:56.33,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,If a Noob completes the course, they get \Ntheir iron boots and they become a Parkour Pro.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.33,0:01:59.02,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Now, they're on the second \Nlevel of Parkour Civilization
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.02,0:02:01.19,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,and the jumps are harder than the bottom level.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.19,0:02:03.50,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,As a Pro, if you miss a single jump,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.50,0:02:06.55,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,you'll fall back down to the Noob level \Nand you'll lose your rank.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.55,0:02:09.12,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,The only way to get back up \Nis to do the course again.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.12,0:02:11.64,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,But if you can handle all of the jumps at the Pro level,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.64,0:02:15.20,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,you can try to make the course \Nto go even higher in Parkour Civilization.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.20,0:02:18.46,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,The course to rank up is impossibly hard, \Nand if you miss one jump,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.46,0:02:19.58,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,you'll die and lose your rank.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.58,0:02:22.25,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,But if somehow you succeed, \Nyou get your gold boots,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.25,0:02:24.83,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,and you rank up to become a Parkour Master.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.83,0:02:29.30,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Only the best players in Parkour Civilization \Ncan survive the difficulty of jumps up here,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.30,0:02:32.91,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,but it doesn't stop there \Nbecause the only goal in Parkour Civilization
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.91,0:02:35.68,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,is to make it to the top, to become the Champion.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.68,0:02:38.52,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,There's only one Champion, \Nand the only way to become one
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.52,0:02:41.91,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,is to beat the Champion \Nin a parkour battle, which is me again.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.91,0:02:43.62,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Haha, man, I can't stop saying it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.62,0:02:45.76,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,But I even changed the rules for myself.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.76,0:02:50.32,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,So if I miss a single jump and I die, \NI'll rank down and become a Parkour Master again.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.32,0:02:53.21,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,And to be honest, I still \Nhaven't figured out who would be
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.21,0:02:55.40,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,the next Champion after me if that ever happened.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.40,0:02:57.06,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,But I'm not really worried about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.06,0:02:58.83,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,I mean, when's the last time I've missed a jum—

Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.93,0:03:03.94,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,I'm gonna pretend I almost didn't \Njust lose everything I worked for.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.94,0:03:06.90,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,You see, I could have just used \Nmy Totem of Undying and been fine,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.90,0:03:09.02,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,but as the Champion, things are a little different.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.02,0:03:11.07,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,I mean, I got a reputation to maintain.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.07,0:03:13.96,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,I can't have people going around \Nthinking I can't make a water bucket.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.96,0:03:17.25,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,But speaking of reputation, \Nso much of my time has been spent
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.25,0:03:19.58,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,trying to rebuild Parkour City for the better.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.58,0:03:22.90,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Now, life works a lot differently as a Parkour Master.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.90,0:03:25.92,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,The first big change I made was to the Parkour Bank.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.92,0:03:29.90,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,When I was a Master, you could only get blocks \Nif you completed daily tasks.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.90,0:03:32.54,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,But after seeing what life \Nwas like back in the old days,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.54,0:03:34.48,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,I decided to make blocks free again.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.48,0:03:37.52,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Now, Parkour Masters can get \Nas many blocks as they want,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.52,0:03:39.44,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,and they don't have to do daily tasks.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.44,0:03:42.08,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,I even updated the second floor to the Parkour Bank.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.08,0:03:46.15,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Masters can now get whatever they need to build \Nthe hardest jumps in Parkour Civilization.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.15,0:03:49.06,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,But the biggest change \Nwas bringing back Totems of Undying.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.06,0:03:51.92,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Totems are free, but you're only \Nallowed to have one at a time.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.92,0:03:54.72,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,I didn't want people grabbing \Nlike 20 of these and living forever
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.72,0:03:56.80,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,and never ranking down, so one is the max.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.80,0:03:59.04,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,The next change I made was to the food supply.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.04,0:04:02.08,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,When I was a Master, you had to \Nbuild your own jumps to get food,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.08,0:04:05.60,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,and I was not a fan of that system \Nbecause I almost starved because of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.60,0:04:08.19,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,So getting food is now different as a Parkour Master.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.19,0:04:11.54,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Now you have to do two four-block jumps \Nif you wanna get food.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.54,0:04:15.19,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Every day, Masters can make these jumps \Nto get three golden carrots.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.19,0:04:18.62,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Or if you're like me and you're \Nthe Parkour Champion, you never lose hunger.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.62,0:04:20.20,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,So no need to do these jumps.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.20,0:04:21.06,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Uh, all right.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.06,0:04:23.73,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Well, I guess some Parkour Pros \Nabout to be eating good today.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.73,0:04:25.53,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,And of course, even if you do get the food,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.53,0:04:28.12,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,you still have to make \Nthe two four-block jumps to get back.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.12,0:04:32.08,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,Now, onto the part that I don't really have \Nfigured out yet, and that's buying skyscrapers.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.08,0:04:35.31,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,When I was a Master, \NI did two 360s to buy a skyscraper,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.31,0:04:38.19,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,so I kinda like the idea of building \Na jump to buy a house.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.19,0:04:40.92,GJM_Main,,0,0,0,,But the problem is, \Nis that there are no more daily tasks,

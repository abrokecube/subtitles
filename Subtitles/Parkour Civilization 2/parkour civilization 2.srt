1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,330
I used to dream of being the Champion 
of Parkour Civilization, but now I am.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,460
And I gotta admit, being 
the Champion is pretty awesome.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,350
Since I'm the best at parkour, 
I make the rules of Parkour Civilization.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,870
When I was at the bottom level, I always thought 
that parkouring to the top would lead to a better life.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,640
But now, under my rule, 
people can actually <i>live</i> that better life.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,560
You know what, Evbo?

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,080
You are <i>so</i> humble.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,700
I bet it's no coincidence that everything 
in Parkour Civilization is now Evbo themed.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,860
Okay, I'll admit the Evbo theme <i>was</i> intentional.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,660
But let's be honest, you would totally do 
the same if you were the Champion.

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,610
I mean, I don't know if <i>that</i> will ever happen.

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,680
Oh, you think that's funny?

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,700
Let's parkour battle right now and see who wins.

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,400
I can't wait to be the new Champion.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,520
Okay, come on.

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,340
Let's be real here.

17
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,430
You versus me?

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,530
I mean, you do remember our last battle, right?

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,060
I mean, oh, that was rough.

20
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,770
I think you're just scared 
because you don't practice parkour anymore.

21
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,350
All right, if you think you can 
out-parkour me, let's go for a battle.

22
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,640
Honestly, you might be right.

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,480
I don't even think I'm <i>that</i> good anymore.

24
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,030
Whoa, was that a three-block jump with a 360?

25
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,050
Ha! No way I can do that again, right?

26
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,610
Uh, anyways, you still wanna battle?

27
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,320
Oh, no, fine.

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,470
All right, you're still the best.

29
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,840
Haha, we all make mistakes.

30
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,380
It's okay.

31
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,530
Like I said, being the best in 
Parkour Civilization is kind of awesome.

32
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,050
Not only did I save the world, but now I have 
the power to change things for the better.

33
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,050
Since I defeated the evil Champion,

34
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,670
I undid all of the corrupt rules 
that destroyed Parkour Civilization

35
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,500
and now life is totally different.

36
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,410
So this is how it works now in my civilization.

37
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,440
Every new player spawns at the bottom level 
of Parkour Civilization as a Parkour Noob.

38
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,480
There they will learn 
how life works in Parkour Civilization

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,320
and probably fail their first jumps.

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,250
But even if they do it's okay because

41
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,800
they'll just spawn right back inside 
the Parkour Temple.

42
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,420
Once a Noob gets more experienced in parkour

43
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,950
they can attempt the course to rank up to try 
to get to the next level of Parkour Civilization.

44
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,850
And yes, I made sure this course 
was actually possible

45
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,720
and not some evil way to make sure 
that people never ranked up.

46
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,330
If a Noob completes the course, they get 
their iron boots and they become a Parkour Pro.

47
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,020
Now, they're on the second 
level of Parkour Civilization

48
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,190
and the jumps are harder than the bottom level.

49
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,500
As a Pro, if you miss a single jump,

50
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,550
you'll fall back down to the Noob level 
and you'll lose your rank.

51
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,120
The only way to get back up 
is to do the course again.

52
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,640
But if you can handle all of the jumps at the Pro level,

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,200
you can try to make the course 
to go even higher in Parkour Civilization.

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,460
The course to rank up is impossibly hard, 
and if you miss one jump,

55
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,580
you'll die and lose your rank.

56
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,250
But if somehow you succeed, 
you get your gold boots,

57
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,830
and you rank up to become a Parkour Master.

58
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,300
Only the best players in Parkour Civilization 
can survive the difficulty of jumps up here,

59
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,910
but it doesn't stop there 
because the only goal in Parkour Civilization

60
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,680
is to make it to the top, to become the Champion.

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,520
There's only one Champion, 
and the only way to become one

62
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,910
is to beat the Champion 
in a parkour battle, which is me again.

63
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,620
Haha, man, I can't stop saying it.

64
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,760
But I even changed the rules for myself.

65
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,320
So if I miss a single jump and I die, 
I'll rank down and become a Parkour Master again.

66
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,210
And to be honest, I still 
haven't figured out who would be

67
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,400
the next Champion after me if that ever happened.

68
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,060
But I'm not really worried about that.

69
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,830
I mean, when's the last time I've missed a jum—

70
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,370
NOOO!

71
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,930
Please! Oh, okay.

72
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,940
I'm gonna pretend I almost didn't 
just lose everything I worked for.

73
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,900
You see, I could have just used 
my Totem of Undying and been fine,

74
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,020
but as the Champion, things are a little different.

75
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,070
I mean, I got a reputation to maintain.

76
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,960
I can't have people going around 
thinking I can't make a water bucket.

77
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,250
But speaking of reputation, 
so much of my time has been spent

78
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,580
trying to rebuild Parkour City for the better.

79
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,900
Now, life works a lot differently as a Parkour Master.

80
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,920
The first big change I made was to the Parkour Bank.

81
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,900
When I was a Master, you could only get blocks 
if you completed daily tasks.

82
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,540
But after seeing what life 
was like back in the old days,

83
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,480
I decided to make blocks free again.

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,520
Now, Parkour Masters can get 
as many blocks as they want,

85
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,440
and they don't have to do daily tasks.

86
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,080
I even updated the second floor to the Parkour Bank.

87
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,150
Masters can now get whatever they need to build 
the hardest jumps in Parkour Civilization.

88
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,060
But the biggest change 
was bringing back Totems of Undying.

89
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,920
Totems are free, but you're only 
allowed to have one at a time.

90
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,720
I didn't want people grabbing 
like 20 of these and living forever

91
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,800
and never ranking down, so one is the max.

92
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,040
The next change I made was to the food supply.

93
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,080
When I was a Master, you had to 
build your own jumps to get food,

94
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,600
and I was not a fan of that system 
because I almost starved because of it.

95
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,190
So getting food is now different as a Parkour Master.

96
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,540
Now you have to do two four-block jumps 
if you wanna get food.

97
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,190
Every day, Masters can make these jumps 
to get three golden carrots.

98
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,620
Or if you're like me and you're 
the Parkour Champion, you never lose hunger.

99
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,200
So no need to do these jumps.

100
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,060
Uh, all right.

101
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,730
Well, I guess some Parkour Pros 
about to be eating good today.

102
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,530
And of course, even if you do get the food,

103
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,120
you still have to make 
the two four-block jumps to get back.

104
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,080
Now, onto the part that I don't really have 
figured out yet, and that's buying skyscrapers.

105
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,310
When I was a Master, 
I did two 360s to buy a skyscraper,

106
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,190
so I kinda like the idea of building 
a jump to buy a house.

107
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,920
But the problem is, 
is that there are no more daily tasks,

108
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,890
so I don't know who's gonna sell the houses.

109
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,910
Okay, I don't have everything figured out yet, 
but this is my favorite part of Parkour City.

110
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,740
The new Parkour Arena.

111
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,420
Being a Noob or being a Pro is just 
about building your parkour skills.

112
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,760
But becoming a Master is when you actually 
have to learn how to fight with parkour.

113
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,610
And this is the new place to do it.

114
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,060
Up here, Masters have everything they need 
to challenge each other to parkour battles.

115
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,770
They can battle for fun 
or they can battle to the death.

116
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,440
I haven't really figured out 
if I should set a rule on that.

117
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,020
But anyways, this is also the place that Masters go to

118
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,900
if they wanna challenge me 
to become the Parkour Champion.

119
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,860
But I probably gotta change some things 
because I was <i>not</i> ready for the first day.

120
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,610
All right, well, parkour battles are open to the public.

121
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,270
Oh, look at that.

122
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,530
I already got some challengers.

123
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,560
Wait, how many?

124
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,250
Bro, what?

125
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,720
How many people wanna challenge me?

126
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,680
I realized that Masters usually never saw 
the Parkour Champion, so this was new to them.

127
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,950
Hello, Champion Evbo.

128
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,120
I can't wait to die in this parkour battle.

129
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,150
Oh yeah, good luck to you too.

130
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,810
Wait, what?

131
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,900
All right, let's do this.

132
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,440
Parkour battle starts now.

133
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,930
Wait, wait, wait.

134
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,300
Can you please attack me with a 360 jump?

135
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,890
You <i>want</i> me to attack you with a 360?

136
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,790
Yes, please!

137
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,620
Okay, I guess I can do that.

138
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,630
Bro, what is going on?

139
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,020
Can this guy do a 360?

140
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,060
All right, I'm attacking you 
with a three-block 360 jump.

141
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,220
No way, you actually did the 360!

142
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,220
I am so confused.

143
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,560
What is this parkour battle?

144
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,800
Wait, you didn't even try it.

145
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,520
I know!

146
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,800
I get to die by <i>The</i> Champion Evbo's 360!

147
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,330
This is the best day ever!

148
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,260
You wanted to— Oh, shoot.

149
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,520
Okay, this is so weird.

150
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,460
If this is how all of the challenges are gonna go,

151
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,480
I need to make some new rules on parkour battles.

152
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,350
Overall, it's safe to say that things 
are going great in Parkour Civilization.

153
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,580
People are now free, and life is what it should be like.

154
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,960
But even though things are going so well, 
there's still one small thing

155
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,920
I haven't been able to wrap my head around.

156
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,210
At the edge of Parkour Civilization, 
there's a bridge that leads to nowhere.

157
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,030
My friend who found this said 
that this wasn't here before,

158
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,600
meaning that whatever or whoever 
made this must have done it recently.

159
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,080
The thing is, is that no one knows 
what's outside of Parkour Civilization.

160
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,210
Once you reach the edge, the jumps just stop 
and there's nowhere left to go.

161
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,780
So far, my friend and I haven't 
figured out anything new, except for now.

162
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,840
All right, man, what's going on?

163
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,750
This is strange.

164
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,550
Something's stopping me 
from building the bridge even further.

165
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,980
But this is where it gets weird.

166
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,320
I tried throwing blocks, and they just disappear.

167
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,380
My friend was right.

168
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,650
He gave me a block to throw, and when I threw it, 
it just disappeared instead of falling.

169
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,380
It's like there's something here, 
something that I can't see.

170
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,600
Alright, well, looks like 
there's nothing left for us to do.

171
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,750
I gotta go visit the old man.

172
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,180
I said I'd visit him like 
a long time ago and I never did.

173
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,950
Before we found the bridge 
at the edge of Parkour Civilization,

174
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,900
the old man said he needed to tell me something 
that he should have told me a long time ago.

175
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,220
But I just got so busy with 
Champion stuff and trying to change

176
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,490
the entire rules of society and whatnot, 
and I forgot to come down here.

177
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,410
Alright, old man, I'm ready for your story.

178
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,450
And of course he's gone.

179
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,730
Bro, why does this guy always 
disappear when I need him?

180
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,580
I need to put like a tracker on him or something.

181
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,320
I looked around the neighborhood 
and I had no clue where he went

182
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,120
until I finally saw the old man 
just standing in the distance.

183
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,080
Oh, that's a relief.

184
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,720
I thought he was trying 
to pull another jump-in-the-void move on me.

185
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,870
Can you at least leave a sign or something 
when you go places so I can find you?

186
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,550
Wait, what?

187
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,920
Why are you taking damage?

188
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,940
What's going on?

189
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,220
Evbo, you made it.

190
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,060
Quick, I don't have much time.

191
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,300
I'm old, and I'm dying, but I needed you to hear this.

192
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,200
No... no, no, no, no.

193
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
This can't be happening.

194
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,940
Why... why didn't you say anything?

195
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,050
I could have done something.

196
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,790
I don't get it!

197
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,480
You know I have the Command Blocks!

198
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,010
We... we could have found you a cure.

199
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,180
There is no cure for old age, my boy.

200
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,610
It is not my destiny to live on, but it is your destiny

201
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,060
to keep going and to save 
Parkour Civilization once more.

202
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,890
I should have told you sooner about 
the fifth layer of Parkour Civilization,

203
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,910
but it is too late.

204
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,830
I fear that evil is returning.

205
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,510
The fifth layer of Parkour Civilization?

206
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,310
Beyond the edge, you'll find it.

207
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,090
If this evil returns, 
Parkour Civilization will be destroyed.

208
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,040
That's where the bridge leads to?

209
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,720
Another level of Parkour Civilization.

210
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,110
My time is here, Evbo.

211
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,090
I need you to end my suffering with a parkour battle.

212
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,550
No, that's not fair!

213
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,840
You can't ask me to do that!

214
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,170
I'm not asking, Evbo.

215
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,480
I need this. Please.

216
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,910
I never would have thought this 
was what it would come to,

217
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,370
but the old man gave me no choice, 
and I had to honor his word.

218
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,380
Thank you Evbo for everything.

219
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,050
You are and always will be 
a better Champion than I ever was.

220
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,610
I hope to be with the Parkour God now.

221
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,020
And just like that, the old man, 
my mentor, and my friend was gone.

222
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,860
Without him, I would have never become 
the Champion of Parkour Civilization.

223
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,440
And now there's a new evil that I'll have to 
face alone without the help of the old man.

224
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,580
But he trusted me.

225
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,250
He knew that I was the only one 
capable of saving Parkour Civilization.

226
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,370
So now wasn't the time to stop.

227
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,800
Now was time to honor the old man's 
legacy by finding this lost civilization

228
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,270
and getting rid of this evil 
before it destroys all of Parkour Civilization.

229
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,700
Alright, well, this is it.

230
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,510
Somewhere beyond this bridge is the lost civilization.

231
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,040
And I think we both know that 
the only way I can get there is to just jump.

232
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,120
Look, I don't know what's 
gonna be on the other side,

233
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,580
but if anything happens, 
I trust you with Parkour Civilization.

234
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,960
Just make sure you get better 
at 360s while I'm gone.

235
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,150
We'll both be doing 360s 
once we make it back together.

236
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,450
See you on the other side.

237
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,310
No, no, no, wait!

238
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,440
But before I could stop him, 
my friend jumped off the end of the bridge

239
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,320
and he just disappeared in thin air.

240
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,760
Ahh, of course he did that.

241
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,330
Alright, well, I guess this is now not a solo mission.

242
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,940
I have no way of knowing what lies 
beyond the bridge,

243
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,480
and there's a very real chance 
that I never see Parkour Civilization ever again.

244
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,850
But I spent my life fighting 
to save Parkour Civilization,

245
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,780
and if there's an evil out there 
that threatens to destroy the world,

246
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,120
then I'm gonna fight again.

247
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,800
At the very least, I owe it to the old man to try.

248
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,620
Okay, time to find out if I can parkour on water.

249
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,390
Yep, I knew this was such a bad idea.

250
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,760
Okay, I'm still alive, for now.

251
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,120
Alright, just one jump at a time.

252
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,540
I only have to do like, uh, 
five more of those, of course.

253
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,950
Yep, I'm not making it back to Parkour Civilization.

254
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,200
In all my time in Parkour Civilization, 
I've never heard of water parkour.

255
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,390
But you know what they say, 
the first time to try is when

256
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,860
you're floating over the void in a civilization 
that you never knew existed.

257
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,320
The worst part is, is that I don't even know 
if I have a way back to Parkour Civilization.

258
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,230
Things were going great 
as the Champion of Parkour Civilization,

259
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,390
but of course, all good things come to an end.

260
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,480
Someone made a bridge at the edge of the world 
that leads to a new civilization.

261
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,930
And the old man told me that there's an evil here 
that could destroy Parkour Civilization.

262
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,220
The old man believed that I could be 
the one to save the world again.

263
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,140
And if that meant jumping off a bridge 
at the edge of the world, then so be it.

264
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,440
After jumping, I was teleported 
to this new civilization with one problem.

265
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,820
My friend was gone.

266
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,700
I don't know what happened to him 
or if he's even alive still,

267
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,600
but all I know is that I'm stuck in a lost civilization

268
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,720
doing the scariest parkour I've ever done.

269
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,510
Okay, that was <i>way</i> too close.

270
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,480
If I ever make it back to Parkour Civilization, 
I'm adding water jumps to practice.

271
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,560
All right, well, now what to do?

272
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,320
I looked around and saw nothing.

273
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,740
No sign of life, no sign of my friend.

274
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,980
All I could do now was just parkour.

275
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,080
So this was supposed to be 
the fifth layer of Parkour Civilization.

276
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,360
Everywhere I looked was a three-block jump,

277
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,660
which is the same as it is on the Master level.

278
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,790
But that's when I saw something in the distance,

279
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,970
structures made out of blocks 
that I've never seen before.

280
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,640
The old man was telling the truth, 
there <i>is</i> a civilization out here.

281
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,120
But how did they get this far away 
from Parkour Civilization?

282
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,360
And why are they here?

283
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,820
Man, imagine how easy my life would be if someone 
just made a Parkour Civilization history book.

284
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,460
I could have just read about this place 
and I wouldn't have had to risk my life coming here.

285
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,810
But <i>nooo</i>, no one likes to write <i>anything</i> down 
and <i>everyone</i> likes to keep secrets!

286
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,970
Which makes my life <i>sooo</i> much harder...

287
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,980
Ugh, whatever.

288
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,210
I guess what I said before really is true.

289
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,270
Parkour is used for everything in life.

290
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,340
You make jumps to buy a house. 
You make jumps to get food.

291
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,400
But more importantly, 
you make jumps to know the truth.

292
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,770
So now the question is 
how many more jumps do <i>I</i> have to make

293
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,690
to figure out the truth about this place?

294
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,300
From what I saw, it looked like all 
of the houses on this level were abandoned.

295
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,800
That was until they weren't.

296
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,490
On the other side of the house, 
someone came out of the room.

297
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,470
It was a Parkour Pro.

298
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,360
People were actually <i>alive</i> in this civilization.

299
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,320
But when the person came closer, 
I realized this wasn't a Pro at all.

300
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,360
Haha, let's go!

301
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,570
You don't know how happy I am 
to see someone here.

302
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,070
Can you please explain to me 
where we are and who... you are?

303
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,350
You have chain boots.

304
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,150
If you seek to know answers, 
you must beat me in a parkour battle.

305
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,840
Ah, see? This is what I'm talking about.

306
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,170
People can't just say anything 
without doing parkour.

307
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,130
All right, let's battle.

308
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:56,480
I watched as the person in chain boots built 
quite a long parkour combo for his first attack.

309
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,430
Whoever these people were knew how to fight.

310
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,770
You must build the jumps I have built.

311
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,160
The parkour battle will start and end on this block.

312
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,090
The battle will start and end on this block?

313
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,900
What is going on?

314
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,830
Alright, well, he said to build the jumps 
that he just built, so I guess I'll start with that.

315
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,280
I don't know if I should feel bad for him.

316
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,360
I don't know if these people out here know 
that I'm the Parkour Champion.

317
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,490
But, if I gotta destroy someone 
in a parkour battle for some answers,

318
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,980
I got no problem hitting them 
with the classic Evbo 360s.

319
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,480
Alright, I built all the jumps you did.

320
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,040
So how is this gonna work?

321
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,410
Are you gonna attack first?

322
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,000
Or do you want me to attack first?

323
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,600
Are you ready to battle?

324
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,460
I mean, yeah, I've been standing here.

325
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,280
You can go first if you want. I don't care.

326
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,450
I watched as the guy in chain boots did 
a six jump parkour combo for his first attack.

327
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,810
All right, seems easy enough.

328
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,140
-Time for my turn— 
-You lost, Parkour Champion.

329
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,880
We will return and have our revenge.

330
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,560
He knows... who I am.

331
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,470
Something was wrong.

332
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,910
I pulled out my Totem of Undying, and just as I did,

333
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,020
I got hit with an attack that would have killed me.

334
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,860
Whatever this Parkour battle was, 
was something I didn't know how to defend against.

335
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,990
I had to get out of here.

336
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,830
If that person battles me again, 
I don't know if I can survive another attack.

337
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,430
I don't even know what he hit me with.

338
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,300
How did that attack do ten hearts?

339
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,820
And I couldn't even counter 
with an attack of my own.

340
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,250
This is bad. This is so bad.

341
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,880
My Totem of Undying is gone.

342
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,050
If I lose another parkour battle 
or if I miss a single jump, it's over.

343
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,900
I have no second chances, which means

344
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,030
I'm gonna have to do what I do best 
and parkour to survive.

345
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,850
Within a few seconds, the guy in chain boots 
was gonna see me, but I had a plan.

346
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,680
I couldn't run.

347
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,870
I had to fight back.

348
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,980
Right when the guy came around the corner, 
I placed down two blocks

349
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,150
and attacked him with a three-block 360.

350
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,480
From everything I know about parkour battles, 
he had no choice but to accept the challenge.

351
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,820
But if this guy knows something I don't, 
then I just made a huge mistake.

352
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,120
Luckily, it looked like he was forced to battle me.

353
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,770
You have only bought yourself time, Champion.

354
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,000
We will return.

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,240
I watched as the person attempted 
the 360, but they missed it.

356
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,840
Okay, I am very thankful 
that 360s don't exist out here.

357
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,110
I might have gotten lucky in this first 
parkour battle, but now that I know that

358
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,890
there's an entire civilization 
that wants revenge on the Parkour Champion,

359
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,870
I think it's safe to say 
that I am nowhere close to being safe.

360
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,950
The only thing I know now is 
that no one should be living in this house anymore,

361
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,430
so I should be safe <i>here</i>.

362
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,560
Oh man, am I happy to see you.

363
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,440
And just when I thought I caught 
a break, I heard a voice.

364
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,980
And it was the voice of someone 
I thought I got rid of a long time ago.

365
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,360
I slowly turned around 
to see someone standing right behind me.

366
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,150
I thought I was gonna be stuck in here 
alone forever, but now you're here!

367
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,610
Before anything could happen, I set up a three-block 
diagonal jump to get ready to attack with.

368
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bro, chill!

369
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,870
I'm not looking for a fight.

370
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,500
I'm just trying to survive like you.

371
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,720
You can relax.

372
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,660
Seawatt made his way closer to me and I realized he 
wasn't wearing gold boots anymore.

373
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,180
He was wearing chain boots as well.

374
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,570
Hold on, what is going on?

375
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,000
How... are you here?

376
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,240
Pretty crazy, right?

377
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,070
An entire level of Parkour Civilization 
that we didn't even know existed!

378
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,160
It's really cool, but we're kind of stuck here, 
so I guess that's not so cool.

379
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,930
Okay, yeah, I've gotten that by now.

380
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,410
I have eyes of my own, but how did <i>you</i> get here?

381
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,630
Well, I made the bridge, 
which I'm guessing you found.

382
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,410
After you became Champion, I knew I had to run.

383
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,190
I had nowhere to hide, 
but the only chance of survival I had

384
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,940
was the rumor that there was 
a lost civilization somewhere beyond the edge.

385
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,230
And as it turns out, 
it was much more than just a rumor.

386
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,180
So, since <i>you</i> ruined Parkour Civilization...

387
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,360
Uh, you mean saved it from you maniacs?

388
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,220
Yeah, whatever.

389
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,360
I thought I'd start a new life here, but that's 
when I realized everyone in this level is crazy

390
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,540
and wants to destroy Parkour Civilization along 
with everyone in it, which includes me.

391
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,220
So yeah, I could probably use your help here.

392
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,880
Seawatt can't be trusted, and if I decide not to 
attack him, I might be making a huge mistake.

393
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,340
Why would I trust you now, 
after all that you've done?

394
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,820
Bro, I don't have any more blocks to attack you with.

395
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,780
Besides, we need each other 
if we're gonna survive and make it out alive.

396
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,480
Ah, fine. This is gonna be a huge mistake.

397
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,570
Okay, so fill me in.

398
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,440
What exactly is this place?

399
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,080
What was the fifth layer of Parkour Civilization?

400
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,390
I don't know. They were some kind of fighters.

401
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,710
Here, you should put these 
on so you don't stand out.

402
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,300
Really? You think I'm gonna fall for that?

403
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,220
You want me to take off my Champion boots?

404
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,330
What do you think I'm gonna do?

405
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,990
Steal them from your inventory?

406
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,670
That's not even possible! 
I'm just trying to help you hide.

407
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,730
Okay, that's a valid point. I'll give it to you.

408
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,820
Man, I hate it when the villains make sense.

409
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,210
I took off my Champion boots 
and I put on my new pair of chain boots.

410
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,350
I don't even know if this is gonna work, 
but if it helps me avoid at least

411
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,430
one more parkour battle against one of 
these fighters, then I'm all for it.

412
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,670
I followed Seawatt until we arrived 
at what he wanted to show me,

413
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,660
and we were standing in front 
of the Parkour Temple.

414
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,960
But this one was different.

415
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,820
The entire thing was in ruins.

416
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,930
Seawatt said this entire level used to 
exist in Parkour Civilization,

417
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,360
but somehow it was erased and removed 
from history like it never even happened.

418
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,070
The worst part is, is that everyone 
that was on this level of civilization

419
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,400
when it was erased got 
trapped here with no way back.

420
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,400
The question now is how was an entire level 
of Parkour Civilization erased, and why?

421
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,670
I didn't wanna believe it 
but the evidence was right in front of me.

422
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,810
Inside this Parkour Temple 
there was a statue that indicates

423
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,970
that there <i>was</i> a fifth level of civilization.

424
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,050
Okay, this is a lot to wrap my head around.

425
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,570
So, back then, there was a rank between 
being a Pro and being a Master.

426
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,310
And as far as I can tell, 
these people <i>know</i> how to fight.

427
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,220
Maybe a little <i>too</i> well, to be honest.

428
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,890
Seawatt started to make the climb 
to get up to the top of the Parkour Temple.

429
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,560
Back when this level was in Parkour Civilization,

430
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,150
this is the course you would have to do 
to actually become a Parkour Master.

431
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,770
The course to make it to the top 
was starting to fade away,

432
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,340
but if you're good enough at parkour, 
you can still make it.

433
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,750
Of course, it was no problem 
for me being the Champion.

434
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,260
Okay, that was actually kinda close.

435
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,270
All right, let's see what it looks like in here—

436
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,440
Whoa, this was not what 
I was expecting it to look like.

437
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,170
Inside the temple was the place where you would 
rank up if you were on this level of civilization.

438
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,970
Seawatt started telling me 
that there's something in this temple

439
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,420
that the people living on this civilization want.

440
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,520
The problem is, is that they haven't been 
able to get it, because the door is locked.

441
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,310
He said that this course is different 
from all of the others.

442
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,100
He said it wasn't just about making 
the parkour jumps to get up to the top,

443
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,490
but it was about winning the parkour battles.

444
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,660
Apparently, the only way to rank up 
and get that door open

445
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,950
is to win four parkour battles in a row.

446
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,940
But these parkour battles 
weren't just fought against anybody.

447
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,340
They were fought against Parkour Legends.

448
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,500
Each of these four battles 
was fought against a Parkour Legend

449
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,250
who has spent their entire life mastering 
a specific type of parkour.

450
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,940
But Seawatt said these Legends don't just show up.

451
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,240
He said that there are four discs, 
and each disc summons a Parkour Legend.

452
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,020
Only by getting all four, 
you can make it to the top and open the door.

453
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,250
Okay, let me get this straight.

454
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,580
So there are four discs, 
and each disc summons a Parkour Legend,

455
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,570
and you have to beat all four 
in a row in order to get the door open,

456
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,000
and the people on this civilization 
want something behind the door.

457
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,990
So, I guess this is the part where you tell me I need 
to stop them from getting the door open?

458
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,350
Actually, the opposite.

459
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,650
I think they want something 
that will let them escape.

460
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,020
So we need to get the discs first 
and get out of here before they do.

461
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,880
Okay, so we just gotta find the discs 
before these people do

462
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,000
and we can get out of here 
before they destroy the world.

463
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,580
I might be the best player in the world at parkour,

464
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,020
but that doesn't mean I'm not worried 
about the journey ahead.

465
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,510
I mean, the people in this civilization 
have been stuck here for years.

466
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,750
They've had all of this time to find the discs, 
but they haven't gotten a single one of them yet.

467
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,640
That means I can only assume 
that getting a disc is impossible for most people.

468
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,750
Maybe it's even impossible for me.

469
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,710
Bro, how has Seawatt not even made it down yet?

470
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,060
Look, buddy, I know you're 
the mighty Champion and whatnot,

471
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,410
but you should probably play it a bit safer.

472
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,870
If you die here, I don't know what happens.

473
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,650
And if you fall into the void, 
I don't know if you're coming back.

474
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,430
If you don't remember, I <i>don't </i>like you.

475
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,900
So can you just focus on yourself 
and let's get this over with?

476
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,520
Okay, fine. Don't listen to me.

477
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,470
I need to know something.

478
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,210
I came here with my friend and 
when I got here, he was gone.

479
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,410
Just, can you tell me if you saw him or something?

480
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:37,960
Nope.

481
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,000
If you haven't seen him by now, there's 
a good chance he's gone, but maybe I'm wrong.

482
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,560
Here, you're gonna need this.

483
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,710
This compass will guide you to the place 
where you can find the first disc.

484
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,450
Good luck, man.

485
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,680
It was time to go searching for the disc 
that would summon the first Legend of Parkour.

486
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,360
If my friend is alive out 
there somewhere, I'll find him.

487
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,700
But right now, I have to do this journey alone.

488
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,360
Wait, <i>why am I</i> doing this alone?

489
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,930
Wait, you were just gonna sit here 
and watch me risk my life?

490
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,820
Why aren't <i>you</i> coming?

491
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,600
You're the Champion. I can't parkour like you.

492
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,570
Or, if you want to give me blocks so I can fight, 
but I feel like that's not an option.

493
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,150
You're right, I would never give 
you blocks in a million years.

494
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,670
Alright, well, I guess 
that is a valid reason to go by myself.

495
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:18,420
Looks like it's up to me to save the world again, 
but that's kinda my thing.

496
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,590
Just one jump at a time.

497
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,950
Oh no, I hope this isn't a parkour checkpoint.

498
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,920
Stop right there.

499
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,760
Yep, of course it is. I'm in trouble.

500
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,340
We already have a parkour search team looking 
for the disc as we speak.

501
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,970
We weren't expecting more company!

502
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,840
This is really bad.

503
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,960
If I don't find a way past this checkpoint, 
it might be the end of Parkour Civilization.

504
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,690
All right, I got two options. I can talk or I can fight.

505
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,580
Let's try the talking thing first.

506
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,930
I was, uh, transferred here 
from another parkour search team.

507
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,190
Yeah, apparently the job was taking too long.

508
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,190
Yeah, that figures.

509
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,100
Just build the password and I'll let you through.

510
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,590
Oh, great. The password is parkour.

511
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,630
That means there are literally an infinite number 
of possibilities that the password could be,

512
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,120
and there's no way I'm guessing this.

513
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,820
So, no more of the talking thing.

514
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,080
It's time to parkour battle.

515
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,940
I set up a three-jump parkour combo for my attack.

516
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,970
This was it. There is no going back now.

517
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,110
Once I start this battle, 
the guy will know I'm the Parkour Champion

518
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,530
and everyone will be after me.

519
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,850
But I have no choice.

520
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,230
I attacked with a three-block vertical 
to a four-block to a four-block diagonal jump.

521
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:15,880
Let's go.

522
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,380
-I challenge you to a— 
-Alright, password accepted. You're good.

523
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,080
Good luck finding any 
information about the disc. We need it.

524
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,600
Password accepte—

525
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,350
Wait, <i>this</i> was the password?

526
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,700
We can never be too careful.

527
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,840
I heard the Parkour Champion's
 out there somewhere.

528
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,120
I can't believe he <i>actually</i> thought it would be 
a good idea to come here.

529
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,010
Yeah, why would he do that?

530
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,290
Don't worry, we'll find this Parkour Champion.

531
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,100
I heard he's not even that good at parkour.

532
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,630
Oh, okay, good to see my disguise is still working.

533
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,740
Once I made it past the parkour 
checkpoint, everything changed.

534
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,080
All of the grass block jumps 
had turned into ice and snow.

535
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,320
Any normal person would turn around, 
but I have to keep going.

536
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,280
After realizing that I was stranded 
in the fifth layer of Parkour Civilization,

537
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,760
I learned that the only way out of here is to 
find four discs that summon four Parkour Legends.

538
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,170
But if these discs fall into the wrong hands, 
Parkour Civilization might be destroyed.

539
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,070
So the only option I had was 
to team up with my enemy,

540
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,960
because whether I like it or not, 
that might be my only chance to make it out alive.

541
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,750
As much as I don't trust Seawatt, 
the compass definitely led me to the right place.

542
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,760
I was supposed to be finding the disc 
that would summon the Ice Legend of Parkour,

543
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,670
and if I didn't know any better, 
I would say I'm in the right area.

544
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,610
Now, I just need to find this disc 
before anyone gets it.

545
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,960
The problem is, is that 
I don't even know where to start.

546
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,280
I tried looking for clues inside one of these houses, 
but all of the doors were locked.

547
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,560
The fighters on this level have supposedly 
been looking for this disc for a long time,

548
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,160
which can only mean two things.

549
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,750
They can't find it, or they can't get to it.

550
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,230
In the distance, I saw a structure 
that looked like it was a parkour course.

551
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:46,470
When I got closer, I saw that the course 
was made completely out of ice blocks,

552
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,740
and at the very top, there was a dispenser.

553
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,590
An entire course made out of ice sounds like 
where the Ice Legend disc would be.

554
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,850
This has to be it, right?

555
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,890
Maybe the problem wasn't finding 
the disc, but getting to it.

556
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,830
Maybe the jumps were too hard for people, 
or people are just too afraid to try.

557
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,070
Whatever the reason is, I gotta make this course 
before someone else does and get the disc.

558
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,200
The people here might be too afraid 
to try these jumps, but I'm not,

559
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,180
because if the fate of the world depends on it, 
then I won't hesitate to risk my life.

560
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,430
I didn't have too much experience with ice parkour, 
but I was still staying on the blocks,

561
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,550
which is all that mattered.

562
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,640
Only two jumps left. Come on, I can do this.

563
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,480
I went for the last two jumps, 
and I made it to the top.

564
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,770
Let's go, I did it!

565
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,680
So, does that make me an ice parkour legend now?

566
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,880
I mean, I don't see anyone else doing the course.

567
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,530
All right. Let's just hope 
that no one got to the disc before I did.

568
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,190
If it's still here, then I only have three more to go.

569
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,000
Let's do this.

570
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,870
I hit the button and an item came out.

571
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,690
Let's go! It was still here.

572
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,910
I got the disc to summon the, wait, what?

573
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,000
A house key? Bro, are you serious?

574
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,090
I did all of that just to buy a house?

575
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,980
Okay, well, now I'm back to square one.

576
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,420
I have no clue where to find the disc, 
and I bought a house that I don't need.

577
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,240
Now that I think about it, I might be 
the first one in history to have bought a house

578
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,310
on every layer of Parkour Civilization.

579
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,490
Was it worth risking the entire fate 
of the world and my life?

580
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,140
Probably not, but is it cool?

581
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,990
Yes.

582
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,470
Okay, now I have a <i>real</i> reason 
to make it out of here.

583
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,020
I need someone to know this story.

584
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,500
All right, I gotta get back on track.

585
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,670
I need to find this disc.

586
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,590
Whoever lived in these houses 
before were doing some pretty serious parkour.

587
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,050
One of the jumps to get to 
the beds was a five-block ice jump.

588
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,330
Is that even possible?

589
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,360
I opened the chest expecting to find nothing, 
but to my surprise, there was a book.

590
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,400
When I opened it up, 
I realized it was written in parkour.

591
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,440
Luckily for me, I've been learning 
how to read the parkour language,

592
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,250
so I could translate a little bit of it.

593
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,690
The book said that people would live in these houses 
to train for the Ice Legend's course.

594
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,070
The book said that people would 
often spend years here just training

595
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,250
so they could be good enough 
to complete the impossible ice course.

596
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,420
Well, that's reassuring.

597
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,750
I definitely do not have years to train on these jumps.

598
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,300
But the book did mention an Ice Legend's course.

599
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,280
And if the disc was gonna be anywhere, 
it was probably gonna be there.

600
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,430
The only problem now is finding this course.

601
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,050
I mean, it's probably not gonna be 
a big building standing in the middle of the open—

602
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,040
Oh, okay.

603
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,000
Well, I think I found it.

604
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,820
I don't know what the Ice Legend's parkour course 
was, but if I had to guess, this had to be it.

605
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,530
Even from afar, this looked like 
the hardest parkour course I've ever seen.

606
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,040
And I have to be the one to do it 
because the world will end if I don't.

607
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,420
Bro, I don't even get paid 
for being the Parkour Champion.

608
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,510
This is <i>so</i> not worth it.

609
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,120
If this entire course is to just buy another house, 
I think I might just get it over with and jump off.

610
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,530
But I quickly realized that I was 
at the right place, because at that moment,

611
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,420
I saw someone completing the course.

612
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,820
Someone was after the disc.

613
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,360
And right now, they were on track 
to get it before me.

614
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,370
That means not only do I have to survive every jump, 
but I have to do it fast if I wanna catch up.

615
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,880
The problem is that this course 
wasn't the course to go fast on.

616
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,480
These were ice jumps, and 
that means even the slightest miscalculation

617
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,570
could send you sliding right off the edge.

618
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,900
And that's not something I'm interested in doing.

619
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,090
I was only at the beginning, and yet each jump 
seemed like it was getting harder and harder.

620
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,120
This next jump was a head hitter, 
meaning if I mistimed my jump,

621
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,680
<i>No!</i>

622
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,630
Well, let's just make sure I don't do that.

623
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,080
Please!

624
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,940
Oh, okay.

625
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,820
These jumps that I was making were harder than 
anything that even exists in Parkour Civilization.

626
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,010
If I somehow make it back alive, I am definitely 
making the practice courses harder at home.

627
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,660
As much as I wish I had more practice on ice jumps,

628
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,730
I always say that the best time to try new parkour is 
when you're in a life-or-death situation.

629
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,440
Now that I think about it, that saying doesn't 
really make any sense, but who am I kidding?

630
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,010
I'm just stalling because I have to 
do a five-block vertical jump

631
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,400
and there's definitely a 
fifty-fifty chance I don't make it.

632
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,720
But the fear of death never stopped me from trying.

633
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,230
I cleared the five-block vertical jump 
and I was still on the course.

634
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,670
When I looked ahead, 
I saw that I had almost caught up

635
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,120
to the parkour fighter 
that was doing the course with me.

636
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,340
At the rate I'm going, 
I'll pass him and make it to the disc first.

637
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,790
But I also have to hope that he doesn't recognize 
that I'm not one of them.

638
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,700
Wait, what?

639
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,520
Who are you? Why are you here?

640
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,940
I'm supposed to be the only one gathering 
information about the Ice Legend disc.

641
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,710
Oh, uh, yeah, Boss sent me here.

642
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,120
He said you were taking too long 
and he wanted things to speed up, so he sent me.

643
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,890
Bro, why did I say "Boss?"

644
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,350
Oh, if Boss sent you, very well, 
I haven't been able to get past the five-block jump,

645
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,350
but if you think you can do it, go right ahead.

646
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,240
Oh yeah. Yeah. Of course. Heheh.

647
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,010
You know, boss's orders, right? Haha.

648
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,440
Bro. How did that even work?

649
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,500
Okay. Let's just get outta here.

650
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,630
Somehow I escaped the interaction 
without a parkour battle,

651
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,680
which is great because if I had to fight here, 
that would be really bad.

652
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,480
But now I know that they have a boss or a leader.

653
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,710
Someone is leading these fighters 
to go find all of the discs.

654
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,440
And I can only assume that whoever this leader 
is wants revenge on Parkour Civilization.

655
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,650
Well, not even assume.

656
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,400
One guy literally said word-for-word 
he wants revenge on Parkour Civilization.

657
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,360
So I guess that's a pretty clear indicator.

658
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,660
All right, I really need to stop monologuing right 
before I'm about to go for a death-defying jump.

659
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,780
Please make it, please make it.

660
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,330
Oh, that should not have been possible.

661
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,350
With every jump, I felt like 
I was barely staying on the edge,

662
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,920
but I wouldn't expect anything less 
from a course that was made by a Parkour Legend.

663
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,400
Every jump was designed to be nearly impossible, 
including this five-block jump,

664
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,620
which I'm about to complete.

665
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,230
I can make it.

666
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:48,780
No!

667
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,520
Just when I thought my journey was over, 
there was a block under me to catch my fall.

668
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,000
Oh, that could not have been any closer!

669
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,600
How could you have gotten a water bucket?

670
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,270
And I just blew my cover.

671
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,320
I forgot these guys don't have water buckets.

672
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,750
I had no choice but to engage in a parkour battle.

673
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,630
I needed the chance to attack first.

674
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:09,450
And my attack was gonna be something 
that would end the battle immediately.

675
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,510
There you have it.
 A two-block backwards jump, buddy.

676
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,110
And just so you know, 
I've never lost a parkour battle.

677
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,370
Obviously, that's not true.

678
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,780
But the intimidation worked.

679
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,450
The void is more honorable 
than losing a battle to the Champion.

680
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,820
And just like that, the parkour battle was over.

681
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,580
Bro, what do these people have against me?

682
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,050
How is dying in the void more 
honorable than battling me?

683
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:31,600
Despite dealing with a little emotional pain, 
I got rid of the parkour fighter unharmed.

684
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,420
Now, there was no one standing 
in my way to get the disc.

685
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,520
All I had to do was make it past this five-block jump.

686
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,650
The fighters that have been trapped here 
for years haven't been able to make it,

687
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,930
but if there was someone to do it, 
it was gonna be me.

688
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,850
If I was the first one to make the five-block jump, 
that means there's a good chance

689
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,000
that the disc is still here, 
and I only have a few more jumps

690
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,090
before I can get to the top and retrieve it.

691
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,180
I've come too far in this journey to fall now.

692
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,000
Getting this disc means saving the world, 
and maybe even saving my friend,

693
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,130
so I have no choice but to succeed.

694
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,500
I made the last ladder jump, 
and there I was, standing down at

695
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,000
the hardest parkour course I've ever completed.

696
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,100
Now, it's time to find out 
if this journey was truly worth the risk.

697
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,020
Just one more easy jump, nothing crazy.

698
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,850
Oh, okay, no surprise there, 
I never fall on the easy jumps.

699
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,120
It's time to find out if the disc is still here, 
or if it even exists at all.

700
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,090
I walked up and stood on the pedestal, 
and an item appeared in my hand.

701
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,770
This time, it wasn't a house key.

702
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,340
It was the disc to summon the Ice Legend of Parkour.

703
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,060
Seawatt was telling the truth.

704
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,240
He could have led me into a trap, but he didn't.

705
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,370
The discs <i>are</i> real, and now I have one of the four.

706
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,570
All I have to do is get the other three, 
and that's my ticket home.

707
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,480
Hopefully, my friend's still out there, 
so I can bring him home too.

708
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,950
And maybe Seawatt.

709
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,890
I don't really wanna bring him home.

710
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,440
Hey, hold up. Where are you going?

711
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,930
Why are you not gathering 
information about the disc?

712
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,570
You said you were transferred here to help.

713
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,660
Yeah, yeah, I was.

714
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,360
But it looked like the other 
guy had it <i>all</i> under control.

715
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,950
I mean, he was <i>really</i> good at parkour.

716
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,380
He said he didn't need me anymore.

717
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,030
Yeah, that sounds like him, alright.

718
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,870
We've been best friends since we were kids.

719
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,220
I don't know what I'd do without him.

720
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,390
All right, you're good to go.

721
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,660
Thanks, man. Uh, wish you and your friend the best.

722
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,160
Oh, that's so awkward.

723
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,370
I think I might have just created a new supervillain.

724
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,860
All right, I'm sure there's a part of you 
that wanted me to fail,

725
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,870
but I made it back and I got the disc.

726
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,130
No way you actually got the disc.

727
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,300
Yep, one down and three more to go.

728
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,570
We can actually do this... or <i>you</i> can do this.

729
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,450
You got it, man.

730
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,000
The journey was far from over.

731
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,690
Seawatt gave me the compass 
that would lead me to the second Parkour Legend.

732
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:33,010
Now that I have the disc for the Ice Legend, 
I was now searching for the Legend of Glass parkour.

733
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,900
As if the journey wasn't as difficult as it was already, 
this legend just <i>had</i> to be glass.

734
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,250
I have a feeling that there's 
a very slim chance I make it back alive.

735
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,690
Just three more to go.

736
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,250
Just three more.

737
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,080
Getting past a parkour checkpoint is no easy task.

738
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,910
I can't use parkour as a bribe here, 
and I'm definitely not

739
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,470
guessing the parkour password this time.

740
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,900
That means the only way through is to fight.

741
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,000
Saving the world is exhausting.

742
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,420
Alright, let's get this over with.

743
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,280
No point in introducing myself 
since this should be over soon.

744
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,730
You know, I probably shouldn't be this confident 
since these people seem to know

745
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,360
way more about parkour battles than I do, 
but I'm still the Parkour Champion,

746
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,240
so being confident is a part of the job.

747
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,890
I started the battle with 
a three-block vertical sideways ladder jump,

748
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,830
but the parkour fighter didn't even look surprised,

749
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,460
even though I just challenged him 
to a parkour battle.

750
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,490
All right, Champion, 
let's see if you're as good as they say.

751
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,660
I watched as the fighter attempted 
the jump, but failed.

752
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,010
Oh, this is gonna be quicker than I thought.

753
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,690
Okay, that attack should have done 
at least five hearts,

754
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,340
so one more attack and I can get back 
to saving the world.

755
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,450
Might as well just put this guy out of his misery 
and hit him with the signature Evbo 360.

756
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,980
Under pressure, I made a three-block flower pot 360.

757
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,370
Against most people, 
that would have ended the battle,

758
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,760
but I soon realized that this 
wasn't a normal parkour battle.

759
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,600
Oh, great.

760
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,420
I should have just tried guessing the password.

761
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,160
This attack will give you poison.

762
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,050
His attack only works if his jump is harder than mine,

763
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:58,160
but I don't think a three-block brewing 
stand jump is harder than my 360.

764
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,360
I think I'm about to win this, but 
when the fighter went for the jump, he added a 180.

765
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,390
I bet you thought this would be easy.

766
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,560
Adding a 180 to his jump must 
have made his attack harder

767
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,320
because he would have taken damage by now.

768
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,350
This is not good.

769
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:14,640
If I don't build a harder attack right now, 
I'm gonna get poisoned.

770
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,960
And that could be the end of me.

771
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,050
That's why this is a perfect time to set up a jump 
that I've never attempted before.

772
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:20,660
It's simple.

773
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,850
If I make this jump, I win the battle.

774
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,390
And the jump I was going 
for was a three-block ladder 360.

775
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,510
This had to work.

776
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,650
I went for the 360.

777
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,700
Please make it!

778
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,670
But I failed.

779
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,310
The attack hit me and now I was being poisoned.

780
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:38,030
I actually thought I was gonna win this battle, 
but now the odds are stacked against me.

781
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,050
By the time the poison wore off, 
I had half-a-heart left.

782
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:44,110
And the fighter was already 
planning out his next attack.

783
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:47,850
From here on out, if I make 
a single mistake, my journey is over.

784
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,120
But that's why I'm the one trying to save the world.

785
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,080
If it was easy, everyone would be doing it.

786
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,270
The fighter was setting up 
a parkour combo with ice blocks.

787
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,100
Okay, this is good!

788
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,580
I just mastered ice block jum—

789
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,280
Wait, what?

790
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,720
Before the fighter even attempted 
his attack, he just slipped off.

791
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,900
Uhhh, okay, that was <i>not</i> 
how I thought it was gonna end.

792
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,110
Doesn't matter. It looks like it's another win for me.

793
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,070
Haha, let's go!

794
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,900
Even though I barely survived the parkour battle, 
I was stepping into more dangerous territory.

795
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:17,080
This was where I was gonna find the disc 
to summon the Glass Legend of Parkour.

796
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,140
There are four discs I need to find in order 
to get back to Parkour Civilization.

797
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,280
I managed to stay alive 
and get one of the discs so far,

798
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,290
but the parkour fighters 
are still racing to get them before me,

799
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,580
and now I know there's a boss leading them all.

800
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,280
But if I can get the final three 
discs first, I can save the world.

801
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,260
So far, I am very much liking 
the ice more than the glass,

802
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,190
especially since most of the jumps are glass panes.

803
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,640
Not that it makes a difference, 
but before I go any further, let's get my health back.

804
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,980
The entire time I've been here, I've been 
using my Champion boots to gain my hunger back.

805
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,710
That's one part I didn't get.

806
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,680
As the Parkour Champion, 
I don't really need food anymore.

807
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,610
But everyone else does, 
so how are they getting food?

808
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,200
Alright, I'm just gonna focus on getting the disc 
and get out of here as fast as I can.

809
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,220
This journey was different than the last one.

810
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,280
Last time, I made it through the checkpoint 
without blowing my cover,

811
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,420
but this time, well, the guard's in the void.

812
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,240
If some of the other fighters realize 
that the guard is gone, they're gonna come after me.

813
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,490
So, I'm just gonna beat this course, 
get the disc, and get out of here

814
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,020
before any of the fighters can catch me.

815
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,500
Easier said than done, obviously, because this 
wasn't just any ordinary parkour course.

816
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,360
This course was designed 
for someone who is a master at glass parkour.

817
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,770
Now, I'm all for having self-confidence and whatnot,

818
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,910
but the reality is, is that 
I have never done jumps like these.

819
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,210
This course was about 
to be all unexplored territory for me,

820
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,030
and I only have one chance 
to make all of these jumps.

821
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,180
But the clock is ticking, and I need to get these discs 
before any of the fighters do.

822
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,250
You know, I would have been a lot more comfortable

823
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,760
if the glass parkour course 
were glass blocks and not panes,

824
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,920
but when do I ever get my way with anything?

825
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,920
I will say that one thing keeping me going is 
that if I <i>do</i> make it back alive,

826
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,240
I mean, I would <i>have</i> to be 
the greatest of all time at parkour, right?

827
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,520
While that thought sounds amazing, I just 
remembered that I've only gotten one disc so far.

828
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,050
So if I manage to survive this course, which 
by looking at it, doesn't seem likely, to be honest,

829
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:06,200
I still have two more massive parkour courses 
to go through before I can make it back.

830
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,930
All right, let's break this down real quick.

831
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,270
So if I miss a single jump, I die.

832
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:14,160
If I have another battle with a parkour fighter, 
which is probably gonna happen, I die.

833
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,960
And if Seawatt has been plotting against me 
the entire time, uh, well, I probably die.

834
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,360
Well, all right. I think my chances are looking great!

835
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,430
I take that back.

836
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,600
Bro, what even <i>are</i> those parkour jumps?

837
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,910
All right, let's just get this over with.

838
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,120
Glass jumps are all about precision.

839
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,960
Each glass jump is only one eighth 
of the size of a regular block,

840
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,620
meaning each jump has to be the perfect distance.

841
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,260
That also means I get no momentum 
for this three-block vertical jump.

842
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,350
Please, Parkour God!

843
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,280
Oh, okay.

844
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,440
And the next jump is just as hard.

845
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,580
The four-block jump onto 
a single pane was terrifying,

846
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,010
but I went for it and I barely stayed on the edge.

847
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:52,920
Bro, to think I could have been at home, 
just chilling, getting a parkour delivery to my house.

848
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,550
Wait, do I even have a house anymore?

849
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:57,570
Let's see, if this jump is possible, 
I only have to do a two-block jump.

850
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,980
This has to be a shortcut, right?

851
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,170
No way I'm not taking this.

852
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:00,660
Let's go.

853
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,540
I get to skip some—

854
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,150
No!

855
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,690
No, that's a trick for sure.

856
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,650
That jump's not possible.

857
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,260
All right, no shortcuts for me today.

858
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,680
I guess I gotta take the hard way.

859
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,300
I slowly made my way through the course, 
making sure to take my time with every single jump.

860
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,860
As of now, I didn't see any other 
parkour fighters doing the course.

861
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,280
So I didn't need to worry about completing 
this course fast. I just needed to stay alive.

862
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,950
But what if there's no fighters here because someone 
already completed the course and got the disc?

863
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,620
Alright, let's just hope that's not the case.

864
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,120
Oh my— Bro, are you serious?

865
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,520
Not one of these staircases!

866
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,760
Thankfully, I made it to the top 
of the horribly designed staircase.

867
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,680
But then, I saw something on the ground.

868
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,200
Looked like a piece of paper.

869
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,190
I picked it up and it said something on it.

870
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,020
It said, "Don't finish the course?"

871
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,680
I had no clue what to make of this.

872
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,210
I was so close to the end.

873
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,000
I was almost at the second disc.

874
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,500
So either someone is warning me about something,

875
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,530
or this was an attempt to try 
to make me not get the disc.

876
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,520
Well, this just got a lot more complicated.

877
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,930
I decided that the second option was more likely.

878
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,960
The fighters know that I'm looking 
for the discs, so maybe

879
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,340
they had someone put this note here 
to try to get me to stop looking for them.

880
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:07,220
But if that isn't their plan, and someone <i>is</i> 
warning me, then I could be jumping into an ambush.

881
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,200
At this point though, I don't even think it matters.

882
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,210
As of now, the only way I know of getting back 
to Parkour Civilization is getting all four discs.

883
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:18,300
So even if getting this disc is going to lead me 
into a trap, I have to still try to get it.

884
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,550
Only a few more jumps and I would be at the end.

885
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,050
Do I go for a shortcut now?

886
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,980
Why not? Let's do it.

887
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,080
I swear, all of this better be some crazy test 
to become the Parkour God or something

888
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,030
because there's no way I'm doing this for free.

889
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,410
All right, one more jump and the disc is mine.

890
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,250
Let's do this.

891
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,940
I went for the last final jump and I made it.

892
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,120
I had completed the Glass Legend's parkour course.

893
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,830
Let's go! Let's get this disc!

894
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,490
Or let's fall into a trap.

895
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,670
I hope it's the disc.

896
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,010
When I stepped onto the pedestal, the dispenser 
gave me the exact item I wanted to see.

897
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:51,000
The disc to summon the Glass Legend of Parkour 
was now in my possession.

898
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,680
Alright, two down, two to go, and now I just 
gotta worry about getting off of this course.

899
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,980
Oh, this is the worst.

900
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,640
I was making my way back to meet Seawatt 
to get the compass for the third disc,

901
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,960
but that's when I saw something.

902
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,780
It was a massive building that I've never seen before.

903
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:09,390
Obviously, I wanna get the discs and get out of here 
as fast as I can, but my friend is still missing.

904
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:13,310
Maybe there's a chance he's alive and he made it 
into this building and he's hiding here.

905
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,200
Even if he's not here, 
I can afford a little detour to find out.

906
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,710
The building I walked 
into looked like it was some old library,

907
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,150
although most of the bookshelves 
looked like they were empty.

908
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,460
Jeez, this staircase is even worse than the glass one.

909
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,750
I didn't even think that was possible.

910
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,320
I didn't know what I was looking for, 
but at the very least,

911
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,780
I was hoping I could find a book that would 
at least give me a little information.

912
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,310
I looked around until I finally saw 
a bookshelf with a book left in it.

913
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,580
Okay, let me try not to fall off the edge 
while grabbing this.

914
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,760
The book was written in parkour, 
but I could still understand a little bit of it.

915
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,400
It looked like it was talking about the Champion 
boots, something about hunger and powers?

916
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,370
Well, that's not really new information for me.

917
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,820
I've been using these boots 
to feed myself the entire time.

918
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,090
Okay, let's see what else I can find in this library.

919
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,900
I looked around and still, 
there was no sight of my friend.

920
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,990
I knew the chances were slim, but some part 
of me still believed that he would be here.

921
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,670
But that's when I went up 
to the next floor and I saw someone.

922
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,350
Oh no, I do not wanna battle.

923
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,550
Please just don't turn around.

924
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,410
And... she turned around.

925
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,460
It's you.

926
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,530
You're back.

927
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,610
Oh, I always knew you would change your mind.

928
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,780
Uh, right. I'm back.

929
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,700
I never blamed you for what you did.

930
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,820
I know it was a tough decision.

931
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:23,070
Okay, this woman does <i>not</i> know who I am, 
but I have no clue what she's talking about.

932
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,570
I just gotta go with it, I guess.

933
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,830
I assume you're here to get your friend, correct?

934
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,030
My—my friend?

935
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,140
You know where my friend is?

936
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,280
Oh, yes.

937
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,490
I got the book around here somewhere.

938
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,560
Forgive me.

939
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,510
It's been a while since I've had to do parkour.

940
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,230
I should be able to reach it.

941
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,290
Oh, not to worry.

942
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,230
It's—I'll—I'll get it. It's easy parkour.

943
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,640
It's just that book right there, right? 
Yeah, don't worry.

944
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,040
I'll do—

945
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,690
NOOO!

946
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,870
Oh, no, that's not good.

947
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,390
Well, at least she went out quickly.

948
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,620
All right, let's go get this book.

949
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,080
I grabbed the book off the shelf 
and I started reading.

950
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,130
The book said something about a prison.

951
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,560
A prison where it's impossible to parkour.

952
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,040
If the fighters captured my friend, 
that's probably where they took him.

953
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,080
This is good news.

954
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,450
This is great news, actually.

955
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:07,690
This is the only evidence I have 
that my friend might be alive.

956
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,020
And maybe Seawatt knows where this prison is.

957
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,680
I made my way back to Seawatt 
to get the third compass from him.

958
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,830
All right, I'm back, whether you like it or not.

959
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,160
Hello, Seawatt, where—

960
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,480
What are you doing in the corner?

961
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,350
Are you napping?

962
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,970
Bro, I'm tired.

963
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:22,100
You take so long to get these things.

964
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,860
<i>I </i>take so long to get these things?

965
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,990
Bro, I hate you so much.

966
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:29,520
I got the second disc, but it's getting a little trickier 
to get past the checkpoints, but I still got it.

967
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,830
I'm ready to go get the third one.

968
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:36,180
Seawatt threw me the third compass 
that would lead me to the Legend of Crystal parkour.

969
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,900
There's one more thing.

970
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,480
I think my friend might still be alive in some prison.

971
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,740
Do you know anything about it?

972
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,370
If that's true, then there's a chance we can save him,

973
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,970
but we gotta get the third and fourth disc first.

974
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:47,770
Okay, you're right.

975
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:51,850
We'll get the discs before the fighters do, 
we'll save my friend, and we'll get out of here.

976
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:55,550
As the journey goes on, the jumps get harder 
and the stakes get higher.

977
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:59,720
I've saved the world by myself before, 
but this time, I don't know if I can do it alone.

978
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,880
But if I can find my friend before it's too late, 
then I think we have a chance.

979
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,170
If I make this parkour course, 
I'm one step closer to saving the world.

980
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,760
Even though this is parkour I've never done before,

981
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,810
the good news is I can take my time 
because there's no one else doing the—

982
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,750
Oh no I take that back, there is 
someone doing the course, this is not good.

983
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,300
If that person makes the parkour course before I do,

984
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,960
they'll have their hands on one of 
the four discs I need to save the world.

985
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,790
Which means I can not take 
this parkour course slowly.

986
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:29,190
Every single one of these parkour jumps 
were made up of crystals,

987
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:32,990
and in all my time in Parkour Civilization, 
I've never seen jumps like these.

988
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,210
But I had to go fast.

989
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,150
I had to make the—

990
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,610
NO!

991
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,380
I was the guy who saved Parkour Civilization,

992
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,410
and I actually believed I could be 
the one to do it again.

993
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,680
I had made two of the hardest courses 
I've ever done to get two of the discs,

994
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,700
and I was on my way to get the third one.

995
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,490
But maybe it wasn't my destiny 
to make it out of this place alive.

996
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:56,980
When I went searching for the Crystal Legend of 
Parkour, I knew the journey was gonna be rough.

997
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,210
The last time I made it through 
a parkour checkpoint,

998
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,930
it resulted in a battle that almost cost me my life.

999
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,950
So I kind of figured that this 
checkpoint would go the same way.

1000
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,690
I jumped onto the platform ready to parkour battle,

1001
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:10,580
but the strange thing was is 
that there was no one here.

1002
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,430
There was no one guarding the checkpoint, 
which means I was either

1003
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,920
lucky or I was leading myself into a trap.

1004
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,670
Given everything that has happened, 
it's probably a trap.

1005
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:23,150
But the good news is that it was now just me 
and the hundreds of crystal parkour jumps.

1006
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,030
Even though I avoided a parkour battle, 
I was clearly not out of danger.

1007
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:30,260
I needed to make my way 
over to the Parkour Legend's course,

1008
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,800
but that meant I had to figure out 
what exactly these parkour jumps were.

1009
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,710
Crystal jumps didn't exist in Parkour Civilization.

1010
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,550
I was going into this with zero experience.

1011
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,680
I tried my best to stay on the crystals 
that were entire blocks,

1012
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,450
but at some point I had no choice 
but to jump onto the smaller crystals.

1013
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:50,710
These crystals were barely big enough to stand on, 
and if I made the slightest mistake,

1014
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,290
that could very well mean 
my journey comes to an end.

1015
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,130
Wait for him to show up.

1016
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,734
He will show eventually.

1017
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,360
What was that?

1018
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:57,980
Hello?

1019
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,830
Is anyone there?

1020
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:03,000
Oh, great. I think being stuck in this parkour world 
for so long is making me hallucinate.

1021
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,920
Well, this is nice.

1022
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,830
I have to worry about not dying from parkour, 
and I have to worry about not going crazy.

1023
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,370
I kept making jumps until I arrived 
at the place I needed to be.

1024
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:15,020
The Crystal Legend's parkour course is 
where I could find the third disc.

1025
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,680
If I make it, I'll only need one more disc to go home.

1026
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,100
But I had to go fast.

1027
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,150
I had to make the—

1028
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:20,570
NO!

1029
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,320
And with one jump, my entire journey was over.

1030
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,850
I watched as the world of parkour 
got further and further away.

1031
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,590
There was nothing to save me now.

1032
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:33,040
The damage from the void already started, 
and within seconds, I would be gone forever.

1033
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:33,900
I couldn't do it.

1034
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,920
I thought I could be the one 
to save Parkour Civilization again, but I failed.

1035
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,780
In my last moments of life, 
everything seemed like it was in slow motion.

1036
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,770
I think I must have been going crazy, 
because it looked like I was floating upwards,

1037
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:48,690
but that's when I realized 
I might not be crazy after all.

1038
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:52,730
I wasn't dead yet, and I was slowly 
rising back up to the world of parkour.

1039
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,750
What is going on? How is this possible?

1040
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,420
It was like I was watching my life in reverse.

1041
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,980
I was floating right back up next 
to the jump that I <i>just</i> failed.

1042
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,400
I was at a loss for words, 
but I might have had a second chance after all.

1043
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,680
I positioned myself over one of the jumps, 
and I dropped out of the air.

1044
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,590
I wasn't dead yet.

1045
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,760
I was back on the parkour course.

1046
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,760
In all my life, I've never heard 
of something like this happen.

1047
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,970
If I had to guess, I would say 
the Parkour God saved me once again.

1048
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,230
When I turned around, I saw someone 
for a split-second running away.

1049
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,800
My entire dodging-death feat that I just pulled

1050
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,260
completely made me forget that I was still in danger.

1051
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,460
One of the fighters was ahead of me on this course.

1052
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,200
When I saw them, they were almost at the end,

1053
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,760
which means that person might 
have gotten the disc already.

1054
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,640
But there's no way to know for sure 
that could have been someone else,

1055
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,920
which means I <i>have</i> to complete the course 
to see if the disc is still there.

1056
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,690
Besides, the Parkour God probably pulled 
some strings to get me back on this course,

1057
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,120
so I owe it to him to try.

1058
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,220
In Parkour Civilization, the more jumps you make, 
the more answers you find.

1059
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,970
But I don't know if I will ever be able to do 
enough jumps to find the answer to how I'm alive.

1060
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:55,770
All I can do now is keep making the jumps 
and keep moving forward.

1061
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:59,590
I have to believe that whatever 
or whoever saved me from the void

1062
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,780
wants me to save Parkour Civilization.

1063
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,650
So I'm gonna try to not test my luck again 
and make all of these jumps.

1064
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,900
As of now, I saw no sign of the player 
that was here before me,

1065
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,910
and maybe this could be the reason why.

1066
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,990
Oh boy, I'm definitely gonna need 
another airlift out of the void.

1067
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:15,810
Now was no time to rush.

1068
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:19,250
I had to pay attention to exactly 
how large each crystal was.

1069
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,960
This jump was barely wide enough 
to fit through, but it was possible.

1070
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,220
I jumped into the tunnel, managing to stay 
on the very edge of the bottom crystal.

1071
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:32,180
Even the smallest miscalculation, like hitting my 
arm on the wall, would send me falling into the void.

1072
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,960
But luckily, I made it through the tunnel 
of narrow jumps, and I still had a fighting chance.

1073
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,690
After making it out, I could see the rest of the course,

1074
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,660
and I saw no sign of the fighter 
that was here before me.

1075
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,830
So that means it is very likely 
that the person I saw has gotten the disc already.

1076
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,630
Unfortunately, I have to do a three-and-a-half 
vertical block jump to figure that out.

1077
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,500
I got momentum and I went for one of 
the longest vertical jumps I've ever done.

1078
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,790
Even being the Parkour Champion, 
I didn't even know that was possible.

1079
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:02,520
But that's kind of been a similarity 
across all of these parkour courses.

1080
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,930
Almost all of these jumps that are on the courses

1081
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,250
don't even exist in Parkour Civilization 
and are near impossible.

1082
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:13,120
I hadn't thought about it, but maybe that's a reason 
why this entire civilization was removed.

1083
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,820
Actually, that doesn't really make any sense.

1084
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,430
Alright, let's just make it out alive 
and maybe someone will tell me the actual truth.

1085
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,170
But that's when I went for a jump 
and I heard something again.

1086
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,090
Trust me, I can get the distance.

1087
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,430
Just let me try.

1088
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:27,360
It was another voice, like the one I heard before.

1089
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,880
I don't know where it's coming from.

1090
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,280
I thought it was crazy before, but now that it's 
happening again, I'm starting to really get worried.

1091
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,750
Man, my problems keep stacking.

1092
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:39,460
I need the disc to still be here, I have to not 
die in parkour, and now I have voices in my head.

1093
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,820
Great.

1094
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,020
Well, I'm gonna need a serious 
parkour vacation when I get back.

1095
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,580
Less than ten jumps away stood between me 
and the end of the course.

1096
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:50,270
I just have to keep doing my thing 
and keep making every one of these jumps—

1097
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:50,940
No!

1098
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,250
Okay, let's not do that again.

1099
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,960
Only few can say they can do 
a three-block vertical jump from no momentum.

1100
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,870
Fortunately, I'm one of those few.

1101
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:02,620
And that was the last difficult jump I needed 
to make to complete the course.

1102
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:06,840
Now it was time for the big reveal 
and find out if I did all of that for nothing.

1103
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,150
If someone else has this disc, 
I don't know how I'm gonna get it back,

1104
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,730
but at least I have the other two.

1105
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,000
So worst case scenario, no one gets out of here.

1106
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,680
I stepped up onto the pedestal expecting the worst,

1107
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,950
but to my surprise in my hand was the third disc.

1108
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:23,100
Whoever was on this course 
before me obviously didn't get it.

1109
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,180
And now I'm holding three 
of the four discs needed to get out of here.

1110
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:31,200
Only one more disc remains 
before I can return to Parkour Civilization.

1111
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,250
That is, if I can survive one more of these courses.

1112
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:37,590
I started heading back to Seawatt 
to get the compass for the fourth disc,

1113
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,000
but then it happened again.

1114
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,850
Find me at the houses.

1115
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,740
It was another voice in my head.

1116
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,400
Unless it wasn't a voice in my head to begin with.

1117
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,640
Someone was trying to talk to me 
and they were saying they were at the houses?

1118
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,390
I didn't know what any of the voices meant, 
but that's when I saw somebody.

1119
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:56,450
Standing near one of the houses 
was someone that I recognized.

1120
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:01,260
It was the person I just caught a glimpse of, right 
before I was saved from the void.

1121
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,390
Whoever this was must have been the person 
that sent me the message

1122
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,650
to find them at the houses, 
but the person still had chain boots on.

1123
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,560
This was a parkour fighter, 
meaning there's a good chance that

1124
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,900
this interaction leads to a parkour battle, 
but something about this felt different.

1125
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,890
I don't know why they would be calling me 
here, but I have to find out,

1126
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:21,470
and even if this does end in a battle, 
that's a risk I'm willing to take.

1127
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,860
I walked in to see the fighter standing 
on the other edge of the house.

1128
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,400
Alright, buddy.

1129
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,200
If you wanna fight, let's get it over with.

1130
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,890
If that's how you wanna repay me 
for saving your life, fine.

1131
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:32,220
For saving my life?

1132
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,390
What are you talking about?

1133
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,030
I've never even seen you before.

1134
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:37,120
I was watching you do the course.

1135
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,010
I knew you would fail eventually.

1136
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,080
So I waited until you fell.

1137
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:45,020
When you did, I was there to attack you 
with a brewing stand jump.

1138
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,270
And the effect was Levitation.

1139
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:49,960
You attacked me with parkour right as I fell.

1140
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,480
I didn't even know that was possible.

1141
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,920
This doesn't make any sense.

1142
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,620
Why would you save my life?

1143
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,630
You don't even know who I am.

1144
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:00,160
I know you're the Parkour Champion, 
and the reason I know that

1145
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,620
is because you've been 
the pawn of our game ever since you arrived.

1146
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,270
You've been collecting the discs <i>for</i> us.

1147
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,280
No, no, no, no.

1148
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,180
That's impossible.

1149
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,640
I fought parkour fighters in battles.

1150
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,530
I almost died.

1151
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:14,560
Why would they try to kill me 
if they wanted me to get the discs?

1152
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,240
Seawatt said it would have to be believable.

1153
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,800
Oh, so now Seawatt's behind this mastermind plan?

1154
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,880
Of course he is.

1155
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,320
And if you don't believe me, 
jump onto the center block.

1156
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,890
I jumped into the middle of the house 
and it happened again.

1157
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,620
<i>If he fights you, you have to lose.</i>

1158
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,030
<i>This is the only way we win.</i>

1159
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,670
It was Seawatt's voice.

1160
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:36,060
I don't know how you're doing it, 
but you're making this up.

1161
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,050
I'm not.

1162
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:42,780
If you parkour across crystals while talking, 
messages will be trapped inside for years.

1163
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,670
You're only hearing his voice 
because he was here setting the trap for <i>you</i>.

1164
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,060
I didn't know what to believe.

1165
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:52,950
If this was all true, then I've been getting the discs 
for the enemy the entire time.

1166
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:56,290
At this point, I don't even know 
if anything Seawatt has told me is true.

1167
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:59,570
If you're in on the plan, 
then why are you telling me this?

1168
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:00,900
What do you want?

1169
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,200
Let's just say I don't really like how the plan ends.

1170
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,920
So I'm hoping that by telling you this, 
you find a way to win.

1171
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,750
And in repayment, you can take me back 
to Parkour Civilization.

1172
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,500
How can I be sure you're telling the truth?

1173
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,140
What if Seawatt isn't behind this?

1174
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,870
You think it's a coincidence he has those compasses?

1175
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,850
Why don't you ask him where he got them?

1176
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,210
If all of this was true and Seawatt 
was working with the fighters,

1177
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,220
then I have no one to blame but myself.

1178
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,970
But as far as I'm concerned, I have the three discs.

1179
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,750
I don't know how in the world they 
plan on getting these off of me,

1180
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,380
but if I can get the fourth one, 
then I can get out of here.

1181
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,520
At least now that I know I might be in a trap, 
I can focus on getting myself out of it.

1182
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,520
But I still don't know 
if that fighter was telling me the truth or not.

1183
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,350
Alright, disc number three acquired.

1184
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,890
Wasn't an easy one, that's for sure, but I still got it.

1185
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:46,200
This is insane!

1186
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,360
To be honest, I didn't think you would be 
able to do it, but clearly I'm wrong.

1187
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,810
Only one more to go and we can get out of here.

1188
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,840
Here, the compass to the last Parkour Legend.

1189
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:59,570
This one is supposed to be 
the most terrifying course, so good luck.

1190
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,020
Well, if there's anyone that can get it done, it's me.

1191
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:06,120
Hey, this is just a quick question, 
but where did you get all of the compasses?

1192
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,750
The compasses?

1193
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:08,620
Oh, yeah.

1194
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,540
I was just searching through all the chests, 
and I happened to find all of them.

1195
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:13,950
Lucky find, I guess.

1196
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,010
Yeah, yeah, that is real lucky.

1197
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,120
Oh, that was really convincing.

1198
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,840
Yep, I am definitely in a trap.

1199
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,330
He knows, right?

1200
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,380
Yeah, he must have figured it out.

1201
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,430
It doesn't matter.

1202
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:30,140
The plan is in motion, and at this point, 
there is nothing he can do to stop what's coming.

1203
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:34,160
I must say, this plan didn't go exactly 
how I thought it would,

1204
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,820
but I have everything I need to get my revenge.

1205
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:44,040
Just one more parkour course to go, 
and I can get back to Parkour Civilization.

1206
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,560
Unfortunately, this is gonna be the hardest one yet.

1207
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,240
All of these parkour jumps had one thing in common.

1208
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,750
These were neo jumps.

1209
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:55,490
Neo jumps are considered some of the hardest jumps 
in Parkour Civilization and for a good reason.

1210
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:59,380
The only way you make these jumps 
is by moving around the block in midair.

1211
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:03,900
The last time I made a difficult neo jump, 
I became Parkour Champion and I saved the world.

1212
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:09,130
But that was one jump and I'm afraid this course 
is probably gonna have a lot more than one.

1213
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:13,680
After all, this course was made by the Neo Legend 
of Parkour, so that probably says something.

1214
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,610
If I had a choice, I would turn back immediately, 
but unfortunately I don't.

1215
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:20,250
If I wanna save the world, I need to get the disc.

1216
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:24,750
The entire time I've been here, I've been risking 
my life to get the discs I need to go home.

1217
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:28,000
I thought I've been outsmarting 
the people in this lost civilization,

1218
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,170
but it turns out, I've been in a trap this entire time, 
and Seawatt has been behind it all.

1219
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:37,590
I was tricked into collecting the discs 
for the enemy, and I can only assume that

1220
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,580
they have a plan to get 
the discs off of me so they can escape.

1221
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:44,050
I couldn't help be disappointed 
with myself for trusting Seawatt.

1222
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,000
How did I not see this coming?

1223
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,610
I mean, Seawatt literally worked 
for the Evil Champion

1224
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:52,650
and ran the lab that systematically 
controlled all of Parkour Civilization.

1225
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:56,020
You know, I probably should have thought 
about those things a little more before trusting him,

1226
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,080
but obviously it's way too late now.

1227
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,130
I gotta give him credit.

1228
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:02,350
As much as I dislike Seawatt because he is objectively evil,

1229
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,630
his plan is extremely well thought out.

1230
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:07,330
And now that's put me in a very difficult position.

1231
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:11,540
On one hand, I could just throw all 
of the discs in the void and no one gets them.

1232
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,300
If I went down that route, 
Seawatt and all of the people here

1233
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,980
can't escape and destroy Parkour Civilization, 
but then I wouldn't be able

1234
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,980
to get back home myself, so I'd basically 
be sacrificing myself for option one.

1235
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,630
Now with option two, I continue 
to play my part and get the discs.

1236
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,830
As long as I have all four on me, 
there still might be a way

1237
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:32,310
to get out of here alive without bringing 
them back to Parkour Civilization.

1238
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:37,530
As I was going over all of the possible futures, 
I noticed the course changed to neo ice jumps.

1239
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:42,580
It seemed like this last course was 
a combination of all of the Parkour Legend courses,

1240
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,050
with, of course, adding new jumps to everything.

1241
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,490
Oh, I forgot how much I hated these types of jumps.

1242
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:50,330
Okay, but back to seeing 
if I can outsmart Seawatt's plan.

1243
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:53,780
No matter what option I choose, 
the biggest problem is my friend.

1244
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:57,830
The old woman at the library told me my friend 
is trapped in some prison.

1245
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:59,660
And if I remember correctly,

1246
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,590
<i>There's one more thing.</i>

1247
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:04,070
<i>I think my friend might still be alive in some prison.</i>

1248
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,330
<i>Do you know anything about it?</i>

1249
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:07,960
<i>If that's true, then there's a chance we can save him,</i>

1250
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,580
<i>but we gotta get the third and fourth disc first.</i>

1251
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,440
Well, now that I know that Seawatt 
was the one behind the evil plan,

1252
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,030
I think it's safe to say that Seawatt 
has my friend locked up in a prison somewhere.

1253
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:20,370
If that is the case, then I think 
I know what Seawatt's plan is.

1254
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:24,080
He's gonna use my friend as leverage 
to have me give him the discs.

1255
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,550
It all makes sense now.

1256
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:27,720
There's no way he could get the discs off of me,

1257
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,660
so that means I'll either have to choose 
the discs or the life of my friend.

1258
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,800
That's assuming I finish this course 
and don't die in the void so I can get the last one.

1259
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,830
But to be honest, even though one jump could end 
it all, I knew I was gonna finish this course.

1260
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:44,780
There's a reason Seawatt made this elaborate plan 
to get me to do the courses,

1261
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,550
and it's the same reason why all 
the parkour fighters must have joined him.

1262
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:52,630
There is only one person that exists in this world 
that is good enough at parkour

1263
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:56,860
to make these courses, and 
that person is me, the Parkour Champion.

1264
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:00,780
Seawatt and all of the people in this 
civilization put their faith in <i>me</i>,

1265
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,430
because they knew that without me, 
they would never make it back alive.

1266
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:07,400
Well, I hate to disappoint them, 
but I don't plan on bringing Seawatt

1267
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,260
or the evil parkour fighters back 
to Parkour Civilization.

1268
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:13,700
If all goes according to plan, 
there will only be three people going back home.

1269
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:18,120
So, it's time to get this plan over with 
and get out of this place once and for all.

1270
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:22,550
After making it out of the field of neo jumps, 
I was met with two parkour fighters.

1271
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:25,390
Thank you for retrieving the discs for us, Champion.

1272
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:29,050
Now, you will do exactly what we say 
if you wanna stay alive.

1273
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,090
Seawatt requests your presence.

1274
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:31,810
This was it.

1275
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:36,790
Seawatt had two parkour fighters waiting 
for me to ensure that I didn't run off with the discs.

1276
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,680
Normally, I would say that was 
a well-thought-out plan on his part,

1277
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,710
but I don't think he ever questioned 
the loyalty of his followers.

1278
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,550
Fortunately for me, I've got someone on the inside.

1279
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:46,540
Hey, let's go.

1280
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,710
Keep it moving, Champion.

1281
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:48,640
Why are you stopping?

1282
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,560
Well, you know, just trying to catch my breath 
before this parkour battle.

1283
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,570
I quickly placed down a ladder 
and attacked the parkour fighter

1284
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,630
with a three-block diagonal ladder jump.

1285
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:01,260
You know, I would say good luck in this battle, 
but I think you'll have a hard time with a 2v1.

1286
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:05,760
The parkour fighter turned around to see 
that the other fighter had an attack of his own built.

1287
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,880
Yep, this parkour fighter was my guy on the inside.

1288
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,220
No, you're... working with the Champion?

1289
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:11,940
How could you?

1290
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,260
Fine, it doesn't matter.

1291
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,040
I'll take you both on by myself.

1292
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,820
I'm sure this will be the easiest park—

1293
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,650
Well, that didn't last long.

1294
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,320
Wait a minute, I knew that guy, didn't I?

1295
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,240
<i>We've been best friends since we were kids.</i>

1296
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,600
<i>I don't know what I'd do without him.</i>

1297
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,680
<i>Alright, you're good to go.</i>

1298
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,010
Ohhh, that's right.

1299
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,500
I made his buddy jump into the void.

1300
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,980
Well, at least they're together now.

1301
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,220
Let's keep it moving.

1302
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,520
We don't have much time.

1303
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,130
Yep. All right, sorry. Let's get back to work.

1304
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,580
So far, the plan I had was going smoothly.

1305
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:40,160
Seawatt had his mastermind plan set up for me, 
so it was only fair that I fight back.

1306
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,670
Before I went to the Neo Legend 
course, I visited my ally.

1307
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,070
Okay, I accept your offer.

1308
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:48,100
If you wanna come back 
to Parkour Civilization, you need to help me.

1309
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,250
Finally, you came to your senses.

1310
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:53,450
We're gonna need to move fast 
if we wanna make this work.

1311
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:57,340
So you're saying after I get the disc, 
Seawatt is gonna have fighters waiting for me?

1312
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,470
That's right, but he won't suspect 
that I'm working with you.

1313
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:04,080
I'll make sure I'm one of the fighters 
and we can escape to the temple.

1314
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,330
Alright, sounds good to me.

1315
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:06,720
Aw,  really hope this works.

1316
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,700
Step one was getting the disc.

1317
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,770
Step two was making it 
to the temple without guards.

1318
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:13,730
And now it's time for step three.

1319
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:14,770
Alright, you ready?

1320
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:16,510
Yes, this has to work.

1321
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:20,070
I'll go distract Seawatt and find out 
where he's keeping your friend.

1322
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:23,910
You just focus on beating the Parkour Legends 
and getting the door open.

1323
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,320
Right, the parkour battles.

1324
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,510
I kinda forgot about that.

1325
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:28,000
Time was of the essence.

1326
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,310
I needed my ally to distract Seawatt 
for as long as possible

1327
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:33,500
so I had time to beat the Parkour Legends.

1328
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,970
I also needed to hope that my ally 
would find my Parkour Master friend

1329
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:38,270
and free him from his prison.

1330
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:41,550
There were a lot of moving parts to this plan, 
but I think it could work.

1331
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,530
Unfortunately, the plan already had its first hiccup.

1332
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:47,200
The path I chose to go up the temple was destroyed.

1333
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,040
The only way up to the top was from the other side.

1334
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:54,240
Now, I just gotta hope that those few minutes 
of lost time weren't enough to ruin the plan.

1335
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,460
It was a good sign that I didn't see 
any parkour fighters around though,

1336
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:02,140
but that's when I glanced inside the bottom level 
of the Parkour Temple and I saw someone.

1337
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:06,520
But this wasn't a parkour fighter, 
this was someone with gold boots.

1338
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,930
I ran inside to see my Parkour Master friend 
standing on a single chain over the void.

1339
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:14,290
The last time we saw each other 
was in Parkour Civilization.

1340
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:15,280
You're alive!

1341
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,150
Let's go!

1342
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,350
I— oh no.

1343
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:21,640
Standing to my right was a parkour fighter 
with an attack already set up.

1344
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,750
That's an easy attack.

1345
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,060
Don't worry, I'll handle this.

1346
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:24,980
No, stop.

1347
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,220
That attack was for me.

1348
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,250
If I don't make that jump, I die.

1349
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:31,440
I don't have any blocks 
to build with, so I'm stuck here.

1350
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,120
But if you attack him, that will force his battle 
with me to end, and I'll also die.

1351
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,700
Okay, this is not an ideal situation, 
so how do I stop this?

1352
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,660
You go up.

1353
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,630
Seawatt is waiting for you up there.

1354
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:43,790
Of course he is.

1355
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:47,750
Well, so much for my master plan to defeat the guy 
with the better master plan.

1356
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,320
Don't worry, I'll figure something out.

1357
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,580
Just don't move.

1358
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:53,350
Not that you can move, but don't worry, 
I'll figure something out.

1359
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:56,840
Alright, time to make my way to the top 
and probably face an ambush.

1360
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,270
There was nothing I could do now.

1361
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:00,710
I couldn't think of a single move to get out of this.

1362
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:05,840
If I even make the slightest notion that 
I'm gonna start a parkour battle, my friend will die.

1363
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:10,050
That means I have no choice 
but to just fall right into Seawatt's plan.

1364
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:12,980
Well, I have been known 
to improvise, so let's do that.

1365
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,600
Alright, let's get this over with.

1366
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,410
So, you want me to help you 
destroy Parkour Civilization?

1367
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,580
<i>Now</i> you're talking some sense.

1368
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:23,670
You know, a part of me actually enjoyed 
our little team-up and getting each disc.

1369
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:27,610
I mean, you got them, but it was fun sitting back 
and letting you do the work.

1370
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:34,200
Now, I'm closer than ever to achieving my goal 
of destroying Parkour Civilization once and for all.

1371
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,800
That doesn't make any sense.

1372
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,760
You said it yourself.

1373
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,630
You live in Parkour Civilization.

1374
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,280
Why would you wanna destroy it?

1375
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:46,260
I haven't told this to anyone before, 
but since I've already won, I might as well tell you.

1376
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,430
I didn't join Parkour Civilization.

1377
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:53,160
I was <i>born</i> here on this level of civilization.

1378
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,030
I might be the only one alive who remembers when

1379
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:58,990
this level was still a part of Parkour Civilization,

1380
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:04,120
and, I might be the only one who knows what 
kind of a monster the old man was.

1381
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,540
My parents warned me about the old man.

1382
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,960
They told me to rank up before it was too late.

1383
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,230
Unfortunately, my parents were both too stubborn 
to rank down and too old to rank up.

1384
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:17,910
So, I left my family and became a Parkour Master.

1385
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:22,820
My parents were the ones who told me to use 
brewing stands to give myself the Resistance effect.

1386
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:25,790
And that was exactly what allowed me to remember

1387
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:30,190
when the old man used the Command Blocks 
to wipe out this entire level,

1388
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:31,800
including everyone in it.

1389
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:37,480
In doing so, he wiped all memories of this place, 
except mine, because of the potion effect.

1390
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,720
after that, how could I <i>ever</i> trust the system.

1391
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,670
The so-called "beloved Parkour Champion"
 wiped out my entire family.

1392
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,420
That—that can't be true.

1393
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:49,050
Why would the old man do that?

1394
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:50,400
It just doesn't add up.

1395
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,390
He was kind and nice and he cared about people.

1396
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:56,550
You know the funny part is, 
is that no one even knew.

1397
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,430
It was supposedly over a fight.

1398
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:59,560
Can you believe that?

1399
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:05,630
The old man let his battle with one person 
cause my parents and plenty of others to die.

1400
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:09,360
A fight? What kind of fight 
would lead to an action like that?

1401
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,770
Alright, enough of that.

1402
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,950
What's in the past is in the past.

1403
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:15,770
Let's focus on what's gonna happen from here.

1404
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:17,480
I don't need the discs.

1405
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,850
Instead, I'm gonna have you battle all 
of the Parkour Legends yourself,

1406
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:24,000
and, get that door open for <i>me</i>.

1407
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:28,060
I will then get my revenge on Parkour Civilization.

1408
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:33,000
And if you choose not to, well, 
your friend is obviously the price you pay.

1409
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,040
I have to do it.

1410
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:37,040
I can't let my friend die 
because of the mistakes <i>I</i> made.

1411
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,470
<i>I'm</i> the one who brought him here.

1412
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:40,050
I have no choice.

1413
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,750
Let's just hope I think of something later 
when I get that door opened.

1414
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:45,010
I trust you'll come to the right decision.

1415
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:46,040
You always do.

1416
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,120
Oh, well, here goes nothing.

1417
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,910
Given everything that's happened 
in my life, I never thought

1418
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:53,280
there'd be a time where I'd have to say this, but

1419
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,150
it's time to go help destroy Parkour Civilization.

1420
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,210
It was time to fight the Legends of Parkour.

1421
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:03,650
Under normal circumstances, I probably would 
have been excited for these parkour battles.

1422
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:07,710
I mean, come on, fighting someone 
who has mastered a specific type of parkour?

1423
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:09,600
That sounds pretty awesome to me.

1424
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,590
Unfortunately for me, 
these are <i>not</i> normal circumstances.

1425
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:15,230
Because if I beat all four of these Parkour Legends,

1426
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:17,960
I will cause the downfall of Parkour Civilization.

1427
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,970
But that's assuming I beat 
these Legends in parkour battles,

1428
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:25,820
and if I don't, well, I will die, and Parkour Civilization 
will probably be destroyed anyways.

1429
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:29,610
So, that means plan A is 
to help destroy Parkour Civilization,

1430
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,950
and hope I figure out a plan in the meantime.

1431
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:35,740
I thought I had a real chance 
to beat Seawatt and save the world,

1432
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:39,080
but it turns out he was one 
step ahead of me the entire time.

1433
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:43,920
My friend is captured, and if I don't do 
exactly what Seawatt says, he'll be gone forever.

1434
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,950
So that leaves me with no choice 
but to help Seawatt escape

1435
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:50,280
so he can destroy 
Parkour Civilization once and for all.

1436
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,020
Alright, well, here goes nothing.

1437
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,720
It's time to fight the first Legend of Parkour.

1438
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,830
I threw the disc into the hopper waiting 
for something to happen.

1439
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:02,520
I saw nothing, but then a few seconds later, 
someone appeared on one end of the battlefield.

1440
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,550
And this person was wearing diamond boots.

1441
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,130
So you're the Ice Legend of Parkour?

1442
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:09,570
Why do you have Champion boots on?

1443
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:12,140
That's because I <i>am</i> a Parkour Champion.

1444
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,850
Well, I was one a long time ago.

1445
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:17,680
I won the battle to become 
Champion using ice blocks.

1446
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,030
So yeah, I got the Ice Legend title.

1447
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:23,890
But all of the Parkour Legends 
are just previous Champions throughout history.

1448
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:27,710
So every Parkour Legend was 
a Parkour Champion at some point.

1449
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:28,650
That's awesome!

1450
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:31,780
Wait, so are you real or what even are you?

1451
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,580
Real? Absolutely.

1452
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:36,030
Alive? Eh, not so much.

1453
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:41,300
All of us are spirits of our past lives 
and we exist now only for parkour battles.

1454
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,640
But enough questions.

1455
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,640
Prepare to fight.

1456
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:47,530
The Ice Legend said I have everything I need 
to battle inside the chest.

1457
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:50,220
When I first came here, 
the chest was empty, but now

1458
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,850
the chest had three stacks of ice blocks inside of it.

1459
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:55,980
These ice blocks were 
the only blocks I had to attack with.

1460
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,050
No other types of blocks were allowed.

1461
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:02,750
It's time to find out if I can do ice block jumps better 
than the Ice Legend of Parkour.

1462
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,200
The Ice Legend attacked first.

1463
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,830
His first attack was a four-block vertical jump.

1464
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:10,140
It was a difficult attack for sure, 
but it was nothing I couldn't handle.

1465
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:14,020
My choices were to either make 
the exact same jump or do a harder one,

1466
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:17,750
but I had to remind myself 
that this was only the first of four battles,

1467
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,270
so I'm not gonna try to risk it all in the first fight.

1468
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:23,840
I defended the first attack successfully 
and the battlefield reset.

1469
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,780
Alright, let's go.

1470
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,370
It's my time to attack now.

1471
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:29,690
My first attack was a parkour combo 
with a five-block jump

1472
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:32,050
chained into a three-block diagonal jump.

1473
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:36,750
I thought the attack wouldn't be hard enough, 
but to my surprise, the Ice Legend failed the jump.

1474
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,270
The battle was going my way, 
but it was far from over.

1475
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:43,620
If I mess up and get hit by an attack, 
I don't know how much damage these will do.

1476
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,510
That's why I had to get this over with.

1477
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:48,980
For my next attack, I set up a six block vertical jump.

1478
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:52,110
All of my training with ice blocks 
paid off and I made the jump.

1479
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:53,140
Oh, okay.

1480
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:55,220
I'm just gonna pretend I almost didn't slip off there.

1481
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:59,080
I watched as the Ice Legend went 
for the jump, but failed once again.

1482
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,880
This was the second attack in a row that I landed.

1483
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,580
One more and it should be over.

1484
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,980
But I got ahead of myself.

1485
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:08,200
I attempted two five-block jumps 
in a row, and I failed.

1486
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,290
Oh, that's not good.

1487
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:10,760
I should have just made my attack.

1488
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,550
The Ice Legend set up 
a difficult three-jump combo and made it.

1489
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:15,910
It was time to defend again.

1490
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:18,800
I went for the combo, 
but I slipped off on the third jump.

1491
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,010
The attack did seven hearts of damage.

1492
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:25,590
If these combos get any harder, 
I could risk losing all ten hearts in one attack.

1493
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:28,440
But if I land one more attack, I should win the battle.

1494
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,270
And the only way to attack in this position 
is to do a harder jump than that one.

1495
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:34,400
Okay, it's time for a terrible idea.

1496
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,070
I built the same attack, but added 
a 360 to the five-block diagonal jump.

1497
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:41,410
Let's go, I cannot believe that worked.

1498
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:44,830
This is a level of parkour I have not yet seen.

1499
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:49,050
The risk paid off, and the Ice Legend 
was defenseless against the 360.

1500
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:50,590
Looks like you've won the first battle.

1501
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:51,940
I hope you know what you're doing.

1502
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,190
You hope I know what I'm doing?

1503
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:54,120
Wait, what does that mean?

1504
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:58,760
But before he could answer, the Ice Legend 
was gone, and the parkour battle was over.

1505
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,680
Why did the Ice Legend say that?

1506
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,980
What did he mean by that?

1507
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:05,560
I mean, I know I'm basically causing 
the destruction of Parkour Civilization,

1508
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,980
but I don't know how <i>he</i> would know that.

1509
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,780
Alright, doesn't matter, I'm still alive.

1510
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:11,730
The blocks I used to fight 
with disappeared from my inventory,

1511
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,960
and it was time to move on to the second battle.

1512
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:18,050
Going into the next fight, I realized 
I was wearing my chain boots the entire time.

1513
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:21,420
Since there was no point of trying 
to blend in anymore with the parkour fighters,

1514
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:24,440
I put back on my Champion boots 
and started regenerating health.

1515
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:28,030
Okay, having full hunger makes me feel much better 
about these parkour fights.

1516
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:32,790
So basically, the only way I lose is 
if I get hit by an attack that does ten hearts.

1517
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:34,480
So let's just try not to do that.

1518
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,000
It was time for the second fight.

1519
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,600
I threw in the disc and summoned 
the Glass Legend of Parkour.

1520
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,440
Yo, I'm finally free!

1521
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,340
Let's go!

1522
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:46,440
The old man said I'd be gone for a while, 
but I didn't think it would be <i>that</i> long.

1523
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:46,970
Wait, wait, wait.

1524
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:50,620
Did you say the old man, 
as in, the Parkour Champion old man?

1525
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:51,970
How do you know him?

1526
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:53,960
Bro, I'm not here to answer any questions.

1527
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,310
I'm just trying to parkour battle.

1528
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:56,100
Okay?

1529
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,160
I'm not sure what's up with these Parkour Legends,

1530
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,320
but they clearly don't like to talk about anything.

1531
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:03,170
But I always say you have to parkour 
for the truth sometimes.

1532
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:04,470
So let's go and do that.

1533
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:09,420
I turned around and the Glass Legend already had 
an attack built, but he failed the attack.

1534
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:13,990
It was now my turn, and beating the Ice Legend 
with a 360 made me realize something.

1535
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:17,110
These Legends were Parkour Champions 
a long time ago,

1536
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:20,000
and parkour jumps have evolved so much since then,

1537
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,840
which is why it was time to start attacking 
with jumps from the new age.

1538
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:27,440
I attacked with a one-and-a-half block 
backwards diagonal jump.

1539
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,340
Even when the fate of the world is on the line, 
I'm not afraid to hit him with the Evbo special.

1540
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,550
And it was no surprise 
that the Glass Legend didn't even get close.

1541
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:36,580
Bro, why are you so good?

1542
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,410
I started setting up a more difficult parkour combo.

1543
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,750
If my parkour math is correct, 
this attack should be enough to win.

1544
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,520
Come on, 360, two-block, 360.

1545
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,770
Oh, let's go.

1546
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:48,920
I gotta say, I love parkour battles.

1547
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,190
As expected, the Glass Legend 
of Parkour looked very discouraged,

1548
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:54,250
and I had a feeling the battle was already over.

1549
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,830
He set up the jumps, and he failed the first 360.

1550
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:58,350
Uh, okay.

1551
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:01,220
Hey, no offense, but how did 
you become a Parkour Champion?

1552
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,120
All right, yeah, I wasn't cut out 
for such an important job.

1553
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,110
Alright, bro, I hope you know what you're doing.

1554
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:10,790
And, uh, when you see the next Parkour Champion, 
can you, uh, not mention my name?

1555
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:12,720
Wait, why is this such an important job?

1556
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,140
And he's gone, of course.

1557
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:18,270
Ah, why do I have a feeling that there's 
something important they're not telling me?

1558
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:22,870
The Glass Legend said the old man said he'd be gone 
for a while, but what does that mean?

1559
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:25,060
But that's when I remembered Seawatt's story.

1560
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,270
If the old man did erase this 
entire level of civilization,

1561
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:30,340
maybe the Parkour Legends knew about it.

1562
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:33,770
Okay, I could be onto something here, 
but let's just get past this third battle.

1563
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:36,950
I threw in the disc and summoned 
the third Legend of Parkour.

1564
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:39,520
So, it looks like you're almost at the top.

1565
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,780
The battles must be tiring you out by now.

1566
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:43,520
Uh, I don't know I'm feeling pretty good.

1567
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,770
I mean, the Ice Legend was kind of hard but 
the Glass Legend didn't really fight back that much.

1568
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:49,380
Bro, he was the second battle?

1569
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:53,720
That guy was only the Parkour Champion 
for two hours before I beat him. He's terrible.

1570
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,630
All right, whatever.

1571
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:56,820
I can promise you you're not making it past me.

1572
01:09:56,820 --> 01:10:00,160
Bro, Parkour Champion for two hours?
That's embarrassing.

1573
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,410
I'm kinda surprised he even 
got there in the first place.

1574
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:05,150
It was time to battle the Crystal Legend of Parkour.

1575
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:08,980
Crystals are some of the blocks 
that don't exist in Parkour Civilization.

1576
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:13,010
So as of now, I have zero experience 
with building Crystal Parkour jumps.

1577
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,650
But I had a feeling I was gonna have to adapt quickly.

1578
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:18,470
The Crystal Legend built 
a three-jump parkour combo

1579
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:20,470
that looked like something I've never done before.

1580
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:23,730
I made the first jump, 
but I <i>just</i> barely missed the second jump.

1581
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:26,620
The attack did seven 
and a half hearts, so I was still alive,

1582
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,700
but it was not a good confidence booster.

1583
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:32,320
The Crystal Legend immediately went 
into his second parkour combo attack,

1584
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:36,460
but that's when I saw the perfect opportunity 
to put the battle in my hands.

1585
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:40,570
I built the exact same parkour combo as he did, 
and went back to my strategy

1586
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,390
of adding the Evbo signature 
move whenever it was possible.

1587
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:47,180
Changing the first jump to a 360 put 
the battle back in my favor.

1588
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,830
Surprisingly, the Crystal Legend made the 360,

1589
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:52,080
but didn't get enough momentum 
for the second jump.

1590
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,800
My strategy was working 
for all of the Parkour Legends, so why change?

1591
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,570
I attacked with a backwards 
two-block jump into a backwards 360.

1592
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:02,280
Honestly, <i>I</i> don't even know how I made 
that parkour combo.

1593
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,380
Once again, the Crystal Legend 
of Parkour was defenseless.

1594
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:08,680
Well, there's nothing to say, 
except I hope you know what you're doing.

1595
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,690
Wait, what do you mean?

1596
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:10,460
Good luck.

1597
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,350
And just like that, the battle was won.

1598
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:16,250
But that was the second Parkour Legend to tell me 
that they hope I know what I'm doing.

1599
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,490
I just don't get it.

1600
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:21,290
I feel like the answer is right in front of me, 
but I can't make sense of anything.

1601
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:23,850
The Parkour Legends don't wanna talk, but why?

1602
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:28,130
As far as they're concerned, I'm just trying to open 
the door to get back to Parkour Civilization.

1603
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:31,780
Ah, this doesn't make sense, 
but let's just skip this last battle over with.

1604
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:37,090
I threw in the disc to summon the final 
Legend of Parkour, the Legend of neo jumps.

1605
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:39,390
Well, this is unexpected to be sure.

1606
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:41,120
Nevertheless, here you are.

1607
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,000
This is the last battle to open the door.

1608
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,460
I wish you the best, whatever the outcome may be.

1609
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:49,450
Wait, before we start, can you just tell me what 
the old man has to do with all of this?

1610
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:50,390
I know there's something.

1611
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:54,320
I'm afraid that's not for me to say, 
but if all goes right, you will never know.

1612
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,880
I thought making it to the final Parkour Legend 
would give me some answers,

1613
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,880
but it looks like that's not gonna be the case.

1614
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,930
The two outcomes are I either live 
without the truth or die without the truth,

1615
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:06,060
so, obviously I'm gonna choose option one.

1616
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:09,280
In this final battle, 
the Neo Legend let me attack first.

1617
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:14,040
I started off the battle with a two-block neo jump, 
but the Parkour Legend didn't look worried.

1618
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,940
He built the attack, but then added 
on another neo jump to the end.

1619
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:22,420
Just by the look of it, I already knew that this 
attack would deal heavy damage if I failed it.

1620
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:27,540
But likewise, if I make a harder jump and I make it, 
I could end this battle with one attack.

1621
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:28,780
Alright, that sounds like a plan.

1622
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,100
Let's do two double Neos.

1623
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,870
I made the jump harder and I went for it.

1624
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:32,330
Come on!

1625
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:32,800
No!

1626
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,480
I hit the wall on the second jump, missing 
the counterattack, taking nine hearts of damage.

1627
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:41,640
If that parkour attack was even slightly harder, 
my journey would have been over.

1628
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,830
But the important thing is, 
is it's not, and I must keep fighting.

1629
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:49,720
Unfortunately, I was already under pressure again, 
facing an attack of six neo jumps in a row.

1630
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,700
Okay, nice and easy, one at a time.

1631
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,220
Three, four, come on, just one more,

1632
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:55,090
Please, no!

1633
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:59,430
I saw my life flash before my eyes, 
as the attack took me down to half-a-heart.

1634
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:04,360
I was losing this battle, and if it keeps going this way, 
one more attack will be the end of me.

1635
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:08,200
As of now, I don't see how I can beat 
the Neo Legend at neo Jumps,

1636
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,680
which means I know how this is gonna end.

1637
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:14,540
If I wanna open that door, I'm gonna 
have to do something extremely reckless.

1638
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:17,550
This is quite possibly the worst idea I've ever had.

1639
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:22,430
I watched as the Neo Legend built his next parkour 
combo, but I wasn't even worried about that.

1640
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:23,940
I knew he would make the jumps.

1641
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,160
After all, Neo jumps are his specialty.

1642
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,020
What I was worried about was <i>my</i> jump.

1643
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:32,600
I don't know if this is possible, 
but all I know is that if I make it, I win.

1644
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,390
Of course, if I don't, well, 
we already know how that goes.

1645
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:39,260
It's hard to rationalize this decision 
because I'm basically doing all of this

1646
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:41,780
just for Seawatt to destroy Parkour Civilization,

1647
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:45,600
but it will save my friend and give me time 
to find a way to save the world later.

1648
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,010
All right, time to make this impossible jump.

1649
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:51,030
I mean, this jump could potentially 
change our understanding of par—

1650
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:52,150
Okay, I'm just gonna jump.

1651
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:56,710
I jumped off the platform doing a 180 
and traveled around the block backwards.

1652
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:57,540
Yep, of course.

1653
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,290
What was I thinking?

1654
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:01,370
Journey is over because I thought 
I could do a backwards neo ju—

1655
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,200
Wait, I'm... alive.

1656
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,670
I—I actually did it.

1657
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:09,130
By some miracle, the backwards neo jump 
changed the entire parkour battle.

1658
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:12,160
I have nothing left to say, except I yield.

1659
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:16,020
I don't know who you are, but I hope you have 
the strength for what's to come.

1660
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:18,610
The Neo Legend forfeited the battle and it was over.

1661
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:24,310
I had beaten all four Parkour Legends, 
and the door at the top of the staircase was open.

1662
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:28,280
I survived, and now there was 
a way back to Parkour Civilization.

1663
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:32,170
Except for a second, I forgot 
that I wasn't gonna be the one going back.

1664
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:36,240
I had just barely finished the battle, 
but Seawatt was already waiting for me.

1665
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:41,810
Oh man, well, I survived, but now I have to 
watch Parkour Civilization be destroyed.

1666
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:45,090
I walked into the hallway that was 
at the top of the Parkour Temple.

1667
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:49,030
This reminds me of all of the times 
that I ranked up in Parkour Civilization.

1668
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:52,960
Not that it counts for anything, 
but it's kind of cool that I ranked up again in a way.

1669
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:57,880
I want you to know that everything I told you 
was true, except I left out one thing.

1670
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,700
Couldn't have seen that one coming.

1671
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:00,470
All right, what is it?

1672
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:03,440
The old man's fight was supposedly with his friend.

1673
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,760
With his friend?

1674
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:05,820
Uh, okay.

1675
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:07,150
Is there a point you're trying to get at?

1676
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:09,200
I mean, are you about to come out 
with some crazy take

1677
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,190
about how like we're friends 
and we fight all the time, but it's okay?

1678
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:15,530
I mean, you're literally about 
to destroy Parkour Civilization.

1679
01:15:15,530 --> 01:15:20,140
I never said <i>I </i>would be the one 
to destroy Parkour Civilization.

1680
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:21,750
Wait, what?

1681
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,650
So... what does that mean?

1682
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:25,860
I started thinking about what Seawatt just said.

1683
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:28,170
The old man had a fight with his friend?

1684
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:29,590
Why does that mean something?

1685
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:32,480
Wait, what did that old woman at the library say?

1686
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,820
She thought she knew me, but... how could she?

1687
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:38,770
<i>I never blamed you for what you did.</i>

1688
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,870
<i>I know it was a tough decision.</i>

1689
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,980
<i>Okay, this woman does </i>not<i> know who I am, 
but I have no clue what she's talking about.</i>

1690
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,310
She knew where my friend was, too.

1691
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:50,550
She gave me the book 
that talked about the prison he was in.

1692
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:53,620
<i>I assume you're here to get your friend, correct?</i>

1693
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:54,780
<i>My—my friend?</i>

1694
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:55,850
<i>You know where my friend is?</i>

1695
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:56,470
Wait a minute.

1696
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:59,740
When I... saw her, I wasn't wearing my chain boots.

1697
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:02,080
I was wearing my Champion boots.

1698
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,590
<i>...when the old man used the Command Blocks 
to wipe out this entire level,</i>

1699
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:08,150
<i>including everyone in it.</i>

1700
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:10,900
<i>I never blamed you for what you did.</i>

1701
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,980
<i>I know it was a tough decision.</i>

1702
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:14,740
The woman <i>didn't </i>know me.

1703
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:17,020
She thought I was the old man.

1704
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:21,780
And if she thought I was the old man, 
she wasn't talking about my friend being imprisoned.

1705
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:24,780
<i>The old man's fight was supposedly with his friend.</i>

1706
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,840
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

1707
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:31,850
<i>The old man let his battle with one person 
cause my parents and plenty of others to die.</i>

1708
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:36,860
The old man removed this entire level 
of civilization to imprison <i>his</i> friend.

1709
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:40,770
Getting to the top of this temple was never 
a way back to Parkour Civilization.

1710
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:45,000
It was a prison, and that means 
Seawatt's plan was never to get out.

1711
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,350
It was to help free the person 
that the old man banished from Parkour Civilization.

1712
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:52,080
What have I done.

1713
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,660
So, the old man is gone.

1714
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,070
That's a shame.

1715
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:59,370
If only he was around to see what I'm gonna do.

1716
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,960
The Parkour Civilization.

1717
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:06,850
This is it. One final parkour battle to save the world.

1718
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:10,150
The fate of Parkour Civilization is in my hands now.

1719
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:14,870
And my opponent is one of the most 
fearsome parkour fighters in all of history.

1720
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:17,280
And I was the one who helped him escape.

1721
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:22,960
I defeated every Parkour Legend thinking that I was 
helping Seawatt get back to Parkour Civilization.

1722
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,730
I thought <i>he</i> was gonna be 
the one to destroy the world,

1723
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,780
but it turns out that 
was never his plan to begin with.

1724
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:32,490
His plan was to get me 
to unleash something even worse.

1725
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:35,770
Someone who had been banished 
to this lost civilization.

1726
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:37,100
What have I done?

1727
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,570
Coming to this civilization was a mistake.

1728
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:43,620
I don't know who this person is, 
but if the old man wiped out this entire level

1729
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:47,120
just to imprison his friend, 
it was probably for a good reason.

1730
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,730
That plan took a lot of, well, planning.

1731
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:54,270
And now, you get to watch 
how <i>beautifully</i> this unfolds.

1732
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:55,280
You must be very proud.

1733
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,530
Your plan was perfect.

1734
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:57,940
You have everything you need.

1735
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,180
So, now, give me back my friend.

1736
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,200
Whoa, not yet, buddy.

1737
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,670
Got <i>one</i> more thing to do first.

1738
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:08,750
Why don't you go introduce yourself 
to the Villain of Parkour?

1739
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,740
The Villain of Parkour?

1740
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:14,920
I walked up the steps to see 
the prisoner completely surrounded by lava.

1741
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,460
I hear you were friends with the old man.

1742
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,900
That makes two of us.

1743
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:22,000
I'm surprised he didn't throw 
you away like he did to me.

1744
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,460
If you were actually friends 
with the old man, then explain all of this.

1745
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:31,880
Why would he wipe out an entire level 
of civilization just to imprison one person?

1746
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:34,100
He was scared of what I had discovered.

1747
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,060
What was the term he used again?

1748
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:39,360
Hmm, an <i>illegal</i> form of parkour.

1749
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:44,520
Uh, forgive me for not understanding, 
but you said an <i>illegal</i> form of parkour?

1750
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,880
What could you have discovered 
about parkour to make it illegal?

1751
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,480
It's time.

1752
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,950
Uh, what?

1753
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:53,610
What I discovered is time.

1754
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:56,820
Since the beginning, 
parkour battles have always been

1755
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:00,900
one move after another, 
until I realized that they never had to be.

1756
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:06,760
You see, if you challenge someone to a race, 
it's the ultimate form of parkour fighting.

1757
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:11,880
It's the idea that you are willing to risk everything, 
that you will not only make the jumps,

1758
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,250
but you make them <i>faster</i> than your opponent.

1759
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,820
A parkour race?

1760
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:21,040
When I first came to this level of civilization, 
one of the fighters challenged me to a battle.

1761
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,410
He said that the battle would start 
and end on a single block,

1762
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:28,820
And when I didn't do the jumps, I would have died 
if it wasn't for my Totem of Undying.

1763
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:31,320
That wasn't just a regular parkour battle.

1764
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,930
That was a parkour race.

1765
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:36,090
How was an attack like that able to do ten hearts?

1766
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:37,830
Racing has no limits.

1767
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:42,040
Once you challenge someone to a race, 
you either win, or you die.

1768
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:42,960
No in-between.

1769
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,960
If that's true, then someone with 
that type of power could take over the entire world.

1770
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,160
No one would be able to fight back.

1771
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,400
And that's exactly why Seawatt's 
breaking him out of prison.

1772
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:57,600
The old man must have known 
that parkour racing could destroy thousands of lives.

1773
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,480
That's why he went through 
such great lengths to make sure

1774
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,770
that this type of parkour never made it back 
to Parkour Civilization.

1775
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:04,980
But now it's too late.

1776
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:07,520
I let this evil back into the world.

1777
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:08,560
What do you want?

1778
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,040
What are you even gonna do to Parkour Civilization?

1779
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,120
I'm going to do what I'd set out 
to do a long time ago,

1780
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:18,640
enlighten the world 
with my new form of parkour battles.

1781
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:22,090
I turned around to see 
that Seawatt had built a parkour attack,

1782
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:24,670
but this was something I've never seen before.

1783
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:27,480
Seawatt said there's only 
one more thing I have to do.

1784
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:31,240
If I get hit by this parkour attack, 
he'll give me back my friend.

1785
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,390
What is this attack?

1786
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:33,710
Why are there armor stands?

1787
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:36,050
And why do you need to hit me with the attack?

1788
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:39,150
Uh, you know, I can't beat you in a fair fight,

1789
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:41,240
and, I just wanna land a good hit on you.

1790
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,960
I can't believe that even after Seawatt's plan worked,

1791
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,610
he still feels the need to prove 
that he's better than me.

1792
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:48,430
But it doesn't really matter at this point.

1793
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:52,760
He has my friend, and I have to deal with 
whatever he throws at me so I can get him back.

1794
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:53,500
He could be lying.

1795
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:57,180
This attack might be enough to kill me, 
but I was willing to take that chance.

1796
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:59,300
Thankfully, it barely did any damage.

1797
01:20:59,300 --> 01:20:59,940
Okay, great.

1798
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:03,540
You got the satisfaction of hitting me 
in a parkour battle, so can we be done now?

1799
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:04,500
Who knew?

1800
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:08,200
Armor stand attacks can take 
the boots right off of a player.

1801
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,820
Even Champion boots.

1802
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:13,020
In Seawatt's hand was a pair of Champion boots.

1803
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:14,430
And they weren't just any pair.

1804
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:15,520
They were mine.

1805
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,970
My Champion boots were gone.

1806
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:19,260
Just taken straight out of my inventory.

1807
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:20,560
How is this possible?

1808
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,040
What are you planning to do with those?

1809
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,400
You can relax now.

1810
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,440
Your time as the Champion is over.

1811
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:30,230
I watched as Seawatt walked over to the Parkour 
Villain and threw the Champion boots at his feet.

1812
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:31,760
Oh no, this is not good.

1813
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,680
If the Parkour Villain gets access 
to the Command Blocks,

1814
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,180
there would be no stopping him.

1815
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,220
Well, this is my ticket home.

1816
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:41,450
And just like that, I was no 
longer the Parkour Champion.

1817
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:45,520
I just gave the most dangerous player 
in the world unlimited food

1818
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,930
and access to the blocks 
that control Parkour Civilization.

1819
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:53,210
Seawatt handed him blocks, and at that moment, 
I knew my journey was coming to an end.

1820
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:57,860
Now, before I return to 
Parkour Civilization, I need a good fight.

1821
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:59,880
Yep, this is the end for me.

1822
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,280
Throughout my life, I've overcome 
the most difficult situations,

1823
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,580
but this is a fight that I don't think I can win.

1824
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:10,470
I've never even done a parkour race before, 
and I'm fighting against the person who invented it.

1825
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:14,420
I don't know how I'm gonna do it, but I have to 
find a way to be faster than the Parkour Villain.

1826
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:17,530
The odds are stacked against me, 
but as long as I'm still here,

1827
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:19,610
I'll never stop fighting to save the world.

1828
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:21,070
Well, let's do this.

1829
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:24,270
I have to say, I'm going to enjoy watching this.

1830
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:26,640
I finally get to see you crumble.

1831
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,260
You, prepare for a parkour race.

1832
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:31,390
You've served your purpose in this life.

1833
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:33,850
I offer you a quick and merciless death.

1834
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:36,790
The Parkour Villain didn't challenge <i>me</i> to a battle.

1835
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:38,010
He challenged Seawatt.

1836
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:39,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

1837
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:41,440
I'm the one who helped you escape.

1838
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,730
You, uh, clearly made a mistake.

1839
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:45,890
I'm uh, just gonna take off before I—

1840
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:46,710
What the?

1841
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:48,660
What's... happening to me?

1842
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:49,860
Why am I stuck?

1843
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:51,130
I can't move.

1844
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:54,030
I watched as Seawatt tried 
to run away, but he couldn't.

1845
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:57,620
Whatever the Parkour Villain 
was doing brought him back into the battle.

1846
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:00,220
It was like a force he couldn't escape.

1847
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:01,590
What was this power?

1848
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:03,280
I didn't even know what to think.

1849
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,040
Just a moment ago, I thought I was about to die.

1850
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,750
And now, I'm watching one of my 
greatest enemies fight for <i>his</i> life.

1851
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:12,260
The Parkour Villain didn't even start the race yet.

1852
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,880
He was just watching Seawatt.

1853
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,160
But then, he took off.

1854
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:19,680
Before this, I had never seen someone move 
so effortlessly through a parkour course.

1855
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,520
Within the blink of an eye, 
the Parkour Villain was already at the last jump.

1856
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,160
Please don't! I'll do anything!

1857
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,390
I'll work for you! Just let me live!

1858
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:30,220
The villain made the last jump and the race was over.

1859
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,650
Seawatt lost.

1860
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:35,240
I suppose I had this coming for me, didn't I?

1861
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:39,590
For what it's worth, I was telling the truth 
when I said I enjoyed working with you.

1862
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:43,240
And just like that, the Parkour 
Villain had claimed his first victim.

1863
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:48,220
Seawatt, the one who would betray me over and over 
was betrayed by his own plan.

1864
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:49,700
Right when the battle was over,

1865
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:53,010
the Parkour Villain didn't even acknowledge me 
and started running away.

1866
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:55,800
He must know a way back 
to Parkour Civilization, right?

1867
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:00,130
If that's the case, then there's still a chance 
I can catch up and battle him before he does.

1868
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:03,120
Bro, did he seriously jump off the temple 
with no water bucket?

1869
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,250
Oh man, this guy's insane, 
but I have to battle him, right?

1870
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:09,900
I'm not gonna lie, I was a little relieved 
that he chose to battle Seawatt instead of me,

1871
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:12,580
but I can't let him escape 
without at least putting up a fight.

1872
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:16,160
If I challenge him to a battle 
before he challenges me to a race,

1873
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:18,570
I might be able to keep the battle in my hands.

1874
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:22,680
The Parkour Villain has been trapped here for years, 
and he might know how to parkour race,

1875
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:26,540
but I'm gonna bet he's never battled 
against someone who can do 360s.

1876
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:29,230
I made it down to the ground level 
and I spotted the villain.

1877
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:32,430
He looked like he knew where he was going, 
so he must know the way back.

1878
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:35,120
He was fast, but I managed to keep him in my sights.

1879
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:39,300
I followed him all the way until we hit 
the edge of this level of civilization.

1880
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,550
I don't understand.

1881
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:41,660
There's nowhere left to go.

1882
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,180
Alright, let's not waste any more time.

1883
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:44,620
I only have one shot at this.

1884
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:49,230
I quickly placed down three blocks 
and I attacked with two three-block 360s.

1885
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:50,160
This was it.

1886
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,110
The battle had started 
and there would be no turning back now.

1887
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:54,880
This was life or death.

1888
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,420
I was waiting for you to fight back.

1889
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:00,290
A neat little trick you did there with the 360s.

1890
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:05,100
Unfortunately, my knowledge of parkour is 
beyond your understanding.

1891
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:09,390
The Parkour Villain didn't even look surprised 
that I attacked him with 360s.

1892
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:11,750
Oh no, what did I get myself into?

1893
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:13,200
I wasn't prepared for this.

1894
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,710
The Parkour Villain built a chest jump.

1895
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,800
And the worst part is, is he did a 360.

1896
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,050
That's impossible.

1897
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:22,700
I thought I was the only one who could do 360s.

1898
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,310
My attack was erased.

1899
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:27,010
It was all up to me to build a harder jump now.

1900
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:30,350
The worst part about this fight is 
that we weren't on an even battlefield.

1901
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:34,900
If this was an ordinary fighting space, 
I would try the longest parkour combo I could do.

1902
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,530
But I don't have that option now.

1903
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:38,720
I just have to do one <i>very</i> hard jump.

1904
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:42,700
And that very hard jump is gonna be 
the three-block diagonal 360.

1905
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:46,160
I went for one of the hardest 
360s I've ever done and I made it.

1906
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,620
I still had a chance.

1907
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,780
But then out of nowhere, I took damage.

1908
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:54,050
The jump I built wasn't harder 
than the jump <i>he</i> built and I lost the attack.

1909
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:55,740
Just as I expected.

1910
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:59,850
The villain was looking inside of the chest 
and I knew something was wrong.

1911
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:04,070
Your downfall was your inability 
to risk everything you had.

1912
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,710
Risk everything I had?

1913
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:08,180
But that's when I noticed I had nothing.

1914
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:11,250
Every single thing I had in my inventory was gone.

1915
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,550
No water bucket, no blocks to fight with.

1916
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:16,520
And that's when I knew 
the Parkour Villain stole all of them

1917
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,560
when he attacked me with the chest jump.

1918
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,990
This fight was over and I lost.

1919
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:22,110
So that's it then, right?

1920
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:23,390
You have all of my blocks.

1921
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:24,230
I can't fight back.

1922
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:25,510
How are you even gonna get home?

1923
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:28,160
These boots are the only way out of here.

1924
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:30,040
You could have left at any time you wanted.

1925
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:33,100
I suppose it was your destiny to deliver them to me.

1926
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:34,700
Why aren't you attacking me?

1927
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,490
Why don't you just finish the job already?

1928
01:26:36,490 --> 01:26:38,540
The old man isn't around anymore.

1929
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:41,940
And the only one left to pay for his sins is you.

1930
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:46,300
I want you to know what it's like to suffer, 
to waste away here for years,

1931
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:48,700
to be forgotten, just like I was.

1932
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:53,950
Only when you are on your last breath, 
I will return to finish the job.

1933
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:58,000
The Parkour Villain turned around 
and jumped into the air, disappearing.

1934
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,230
This was the end.

1935
01:26:59,230 --> 01:27:02,650
The Champion boots were the only way back 
to Parkour Civilization.

1936
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:07,080
Now, I'm stuck here with nothing, 
and there's no one left to stop him.

1937
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,840
Just like I remembered it,

1938
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,630
and now it's mine.

1939
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,220
Oh, well, here we are.

1940
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:17,290
This is my last chance to save Parkour Civilization.

1941
01:27:17,290 --> 01:27:20,620
I have to be the one to summon the Parkour God.

1942
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:25,040
Apparently, nobody has ever successfully 
summoned him before, but <i>I've</i> met him.

1943
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:29,080
I know he's real, and I just need him 
to come back one more time.

1944
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,960
Because, let's face it, I destroyed the world.

1945
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,150
I let one of the most evil Parkour Villains escape,

1946
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:38,260
and death and destruction 
follow him everywhere he goes.

1947
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:42,080
I thought <i>I</i> was the champion of parkour, 
but my parkour abilities

1948
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,340
were nothing compared to the Parkour Villain's.

1949
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:48,470
I was completely humiliated, 
like I was just another Parkour Noob,

1950
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:52,430
and all I could do was sit 
and watch as the villain took all of my blocks

1951
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:54,950
and escaped back to Parkour Civilization.

1952
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:59,150
And I was left here to suffer, 
just like the villain did all of these years.

1953
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:03,890
In all of my time in Parkour Civilization, 
I've never experienced defeat like this.

1954
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:08,730
I mean, it only took one jump 
for the Parkour Villain to take every block I had.

1955
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:13,790
It was like he knew every move I was gonna do, 
and all I could do was just sit there and watch.

1956
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:16,170
I started grabbing every block that I could.

1957
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:21,290
Yes, it's true, I may be stuck here forever, 
but my friend is still in the middle of a parkour battle.

1958
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:24,790
If I gather enough blocks, 
maybe he'll have enough resources to win.

1959
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:26,610
I just need these to not fall in the void—

1960
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:29,810
Okay, well, I guess two chests is all I have.

1961
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:34,290
All right, so basically, my friend is gonna 
have to win the parkour battle in one attack.

1962
01:28:34,290 --> 01:28:37,040
And of course, that is, if he's even alive still.

1963
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,920
I started making my way back 
to the Parkour Temple.

1964
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:44,100
Fortunately, when I got there, 
I saw that my friend was still floating over the void.

1965
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:45,190
I didn't have a plan.

1966
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:47,960
I was gonna have to use 
the two chests and improvise,

1967
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:50,870
but that's when I remembered, 
this wasn't my only option.

1968
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:52,760
There might be a way to get more blocks.

1969
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,070
I almost forgot that I had an ally.

1970
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:59,350
We got separated when I fell into Seawatt's trap, 
but he still should be alive.

1971
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:02,320
I went to the place where my ally 
was going to find Seawatt,

1972
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,950
and I found him standing 
in the middle of the battlefield.

1973
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:06,920
Hey, uh, are you alright, man?

1974
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,170
What happened here?

1975
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:09,590
It was an ambush.

1976
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:12,860
I thought I would find Seawatt here, 
but all I found was a fight.

1977
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:15,700
I barely survived, but I have nothing left.

1978
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,590
No more blocks to fight with.

1979
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:19,250
Well, that answered my question.

1980
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:23,310
The only other place I know of blocks is 
at the very top of the Parkour Temple,

1981
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:25,150
but, I don't have a water bucket anymore.

1982
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:26,480
It's just too risky.

1983
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:30,130
If only I could get the Parkour God to come back 
and help us out or something.

1984
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:31,980
Other than that, I have no ideas.

1985
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:33,950
Wait, you might be onto something.

1986
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:38,060
If you actually believe you can summon 
the Parkour God, then follow me.

1987
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:40,790
Uh, wait, I was kind of joking, but alright.

1988
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:42,890
I started to follow the parkour fighter.

1989
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:45,620
At first, I thought we were going back to the library,

1990
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,220
but then I realized he was going further than that.

1991
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:54,530
A few moments later, we arrived at a building, 
and I saw a giant statue of the Parkour God.

1992
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:57,400
The parkour fighter said 
that people would come to this building

1993
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:00,360
to try to get their prayers 
answered by the Parkour God.

1994
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,940
Okay, so you said people 
would come here all the time,

1995
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:05,050
and they just summoned the Parkour God?

1996
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:09,590
People would come here, yes, but no one 
has been able to summon the Parkour God.

1997
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:15,870
Apparently, the last jump you need to do is 
to jump into the void, and no one was willing to.

1998
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:18,770
Great, so I have to die to summon the Parkour God.

1999
01:30:18,770 --> 01:30:21,950
Well, I mean, I'm stuck here forever, 
so it's either die now or die later.

2000
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:24,620
If you do choose to go for it, good luck.

2001
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:26,640
I'm gonna go look for more blocks.

2002
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,380
It's been nice knowing you.

2003
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:30,800
Okay, if I didn't know any better, I would say

2004
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,330
that his tone sounds like he 
thinks I'm not coming back.

2005
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:37,260
So, from what I know, no one 
has been able to summon the Parkour God

2006
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,350
because of the last jump in this course.

2007
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:42,080
But I have some idea 
that it might be different for me.

2008
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:46,480
Back in Parkour Civilization, 
no one even thought the Parkour God really existed.

2009
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,990
But I saw him with my own two eyes.

2010
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:51,490
He gave me the Champion boots to save the world.

2011
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:55,230
He came back before to save my life, 
and maybe he'll do it one more time.

2012
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:58,040
And who knows, maybe 
if he does show up, he'll give me blocks,

2013
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,500
and he'll show me a way out of here.

2014
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:03,900
I just have to make sure not to miss a single jump 
before I even get to the summoning part.

2015
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:07,130
I barely made two three-and-a-half 
block vertical jumps,

2016
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:10,820
and now I had to do, of course, water parkour?

2017
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:14,440
You know, you would think jumping 
into the void would be enough, but <i>noooo</i>!

2018
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:18,840
Instead, I have to not die accidentally, 
and then I have to die on purpose.

2019
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,080
How does that make any sense?

2020
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:24,950
When I first arrived on this level of civilization, 
I was forced to do water jumps to escape.

2021
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:28,360
And now, hopefully, this is 
the last time I'll be doing water jumps.

2022
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:33,200
I made the last jump, and I was standing 
at the base of the Parkour God statue.

2023
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:36,410
A few feet in front of me stood a door, 
and when I walked up to it,

2024
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:39,330
it opened, just like all 
of the Parkour Temple doors did.

2025
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:41,810
I walked inside the room, and I saw nothing.

2026
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:45,730
All that was inside this room was 
a giant hole in the middle of the floor.

2027
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:48,060
And of course, it went straight to the void.

2028
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:52,720
And this is the part when I began to realize 
that I think my ally was telling the truth.

2029
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:55,740
Unless I can somehow miraculously 
make a five-block jump,

2030
01:31:55,740 --> 01:32:00,280
it seems pretty clear that the only thing 
to do here is to jump straight into the void.

2031
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,460
Oh man, I can't believe I'm about to do this.

2032
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:05,510
Alright, Parkour God, if you're listening, 
please send me some help.

2033
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:09,520
I backed up and I jumped into the hole 
with no blocks below me.

2034
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,600
But just as I was about to enter the void,

2035
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,470
I felt my feet hit slime blocks 
and I bounced up onto a ladder.

2036
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:18,160
Okay, that was not what I was expecting to happen.

2037
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:20,140
I didn't know how I was still alive.

2038
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:22,320
The blocks just appeared out of nowhere.

2039
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:25,320
Well, okay, if the Parkour God's advice was

2040
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:28,110
to stop me from jumping into the 
void, I guess I got help.

2041
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:31,220
But I soon realized that my prayers were answered.

2042
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:35,150
Standing in front of me was 
a familiar figure, wearing diamond boots.

2043
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:39,130
You know, it doesn't take much 
to convince you to jump into the void.

2044
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:41,050
You should really think these things through.

2045
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:43,290
I don't get it. How are you standing there?

2046
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:45,900
I saw you die. How is this possible?

2047
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:49,790
You asked the Parkour God for help, so he sent <i>me</i>.

2048
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:51,660
The Parkour God heard me!

2049
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:54,050
You look like you've been through a lot.

2050
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:55,150
Let's talk.

2051
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:56,660
So it is true then.

2052
01:32:56,660 --> 01:33:01,700
You removed this entire level of civilization just 
to imprison the Parkour Villain?

2053
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:04,250
I mean, wasn't there any other way to stop him?

2054
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:08,310
The only other way was to beat him 
in a parkour race, and I couldn't.

2055
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:13,460
So instead, I had to deal with 
the consequences of my actions my entire life.

2056
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:15,160
I'm sorry, Evbo.

2057
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,630
It's fine. I—I actually understand.

2058
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:18,900
There was nothing you could do.

2059
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:21,690
I mean, if anyone's to blame in this situation, it's me.

2060
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:23,620
<i>I</i> was the one who let him out.

2061
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:27,550
Everyone in Parkour Civilization would 
have been fine if I wasn't so reckless.

2062
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:29,750
And now I lost my Champion boots.

2063
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:31,430
Those were the only ticket out of here.

2064
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:36,130
You may not have your Champion boots anymore, 
but there is still a way out of here.

2065
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:37,480
I can go home?

2066
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:38,720
Tell me how.

2067
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,830
You know what they say, sometimes jumping 
in the void can save your life.

2068
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:46,080
I mean, no one has said that before, 
but in this case, it might have just saved mine.

2069
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:49,090
I have a way back to Parkour Civilization, but first,

2070
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:51,920
I just need to get my friend 
out of this parkour battle.

2071
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:56,120
I walked up to my friend, expecting to see 
the parkour fighter waiting with his attack.

2072
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:57,480
But he wasn't here.

2073
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,660
Uh, what's going on?

2074
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:00,250
Where is the guy that attacked you?

2075
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:02,810
You're not gonna believe this, but he fell in the void.

2076
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:06,160
From what I can see, he's never 
coming back, but the problem is,

2077
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:09,110
is that his attack still stands, and I'm at half-a-heart.

2078
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:13,820
The parkour fighter fell into the void during 
a battle, but even if he's gone,

2079
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:16,590
his attack might hit you 
if you don't do a harder jump.

2080
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:19,650
Exactly, so that means 
the only way I can get out of this

2081
01:34:19,650 --> 01:34:22,520
is if you build me a jump 
that's harder than the attack.

2082
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:26,750
Alright, I got very limited blocks, 
so it's time to do some parkour analysis.

2083
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:29,210
I'm not gonna lie, this jump is going to be hard.

2084
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:33,190
The parkour fighter attacked you 
with a three-and-a-half block vertical jump.

2085
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:36,850
Okay, that's not <i>great</i> news, 
but I think we might just be able to work with this.

2086
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:38,800
I placed down one of the chests.

2087
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,420
Now, my friend could do a three-and-a-half 
block diagonal downwards jump.

2088
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:43,800
Okay, we still have a problem.

2089
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,930
Your jump is going downwards, 
and that attack is going upwards,

2090
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:48,470
which means yours is still easier.

2091
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:51,720
I don't see how I could use 
the other chest I have to build a harder jump,

2092
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,620
so that means... you're not gonna like this.

2093
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:56,130
You have to do a 360.

2094
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:57,210
No way, man!

2095
01:34:57,210 --> 01:35:01,060
I can't do a three-and-a-half block
 diagonal 360! Are you crazy?

2096
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:02,840
I'm sorry. This is the only way.

2097
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,550
You have to make this to survive.

2098
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:09,280
Oh, I never thought it would end like this, 
but at least I'll go out doing a 360.

2099
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,230
There was nothing more I could do at this point.

2100
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:12,500
All I could do was watch.

2101
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,500
I wish you never made 360s.

2102
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:18,470
I watched as my friend jumped 
and made the 360 onto the chest.

2103
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:21,830
For the first time in days, 
both me and my friend were safe.

2104
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:22,930
Let's go!

2105
01:35:22,930 --> 01:35:24,730
See, not that hard. I knew you could do it.

2106
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:28,240
My friend was saved, and now 
there was only one thing left to do,

2107
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,540
and that was return to Parkour Civilization.

2108
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:34,450
I didn't find any blocks, but it looks 
like you didn't need them anyways.

2109
01:35:34,450 --> 01:35:36,220
So what happens now?

2110
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:42,140
I may have a way back to Parkour Civilization, 
and the way back was in front of us the whole time.

2111
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:45,610
The old man told me there would be a room 
behind the Champion statue

2112
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:49,790
inside the Parkour Temple, just like 
the secret room back in Parkour Civilization.

2113
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:54,200
Sure enough, the room was here 
and it was nothing except for five parkour jumps.

2114
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,020
The old man apparently made this as a last resort.

2115
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:59,420
So you're jumping in the void on purpose?

2116
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:02,420
Apparently, and surprisingly 
for the second time today.

2117
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:05,580
The old man said that only by failing the fourth jump

2118
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:08,120
will I be able to make it back to Parkour Civilization.

2119
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:10,460
I gave my friends the blocks that I had.

2120
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:14,190
I would be going on this journey alone so they 
were better off in their hands than mine.

2121
01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:17,830
From their perspectives they won't know 
if I had died or made it back home.

2122
01:36:17,830 --> 01:36:19,750
So all they could do was just wait for me.

2123
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:23,080
My friend gave me his last piece of food 
to take on my journey.

2124
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:26,730
If I was gonna die in the void I might 
as well not die on an empty stomach.

2125
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:29,550
Alright, let's jump into the void 
for the second time today.

2126
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:32,140
I'm really hoping I remembered 
the old man's words correctly.

2127
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:33,920
It was the fourth jump, wasn't it?

2128
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,240
Of course, there's nothing down there 
to let me know if I'm in the right spot or not.

2129
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:39,080
Wait, maybe it wasn't the fourth jump.

2130
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:40,180
Maybe it was the fifth.

2131
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:41,920
Oh man, why am I forgetting now?

2132
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,780
This was quite literally 
the only thing I had to remember.

2133
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:48,940
If I die and the entire world gets destroyed 
because I couldn't remember one number,

2134
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:51,320
Well, I guess no one would know it was me, right?

2135
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,840
Okay, I just gotta choose one.

2136
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,090
I think it's number four.

2137
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:54,970
This was it.

2138
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:59,430
This was the only way back, 
and the only way back was to fail a jump.

2139
01:36:59,430 --> 01:37:01,390
Let's just hope I failed the right one.

2140
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:05,680
I was falling through the void, 
but then I felt ground under my feet.

2141
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:08,300
When I jumped, I thought my journey was over.

2142
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:11,190
But I soon realized that there was more to my story.

2143
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:14,530
I was standing in the place 
where my journey first began.

2144
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:16,280
This was <i>my</i> home.

2145
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,800
Parkour Civilization.

2146
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,420
And I was gonna be the one to save it again.

2147
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:25,760
Today could very well be my 
last day in Parkour Civilization.

2148
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,760
If I wanna save the world, I'll have to risk everything.

2149
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,260
I was the one who let the Parkour villain escape,

2150
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:35,190
and if he gets his hands on the Command Blocks, 
he'll be able to destroy the world.

2151
01:37:35,190 --> 01:37:39,220
So, plan A, I cannot let him get to 
the top of Parkour Civilization.

2152
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:43,040
But it was at that moment I realized 
my plan might have already been over.

2153
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,830
I was down at the Noob level of Parkour Civilization,

2154
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:48,220
but no matter where I looked, I saw nothing.

2155
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:50,900
Every building that used to be here was just gone.

2156
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:54,200
I could tell by the holes in the ground 
that a neighborhood used to be here.

2157
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:57,530
This was the neighborhood 
where I grew up in, and it's all gone.

2158
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:59,560
I knew that this only meant one thing.

2159
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:02,150
The Parkour Villain has already made it to the top

2160
01:38:02,150 --> 01:38:05,510
and is using the Command Blocks 
to reshape Parkour Civilization.

2161
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:07,180
Oh man, this is not good.

2162
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:08,640
Well, plan A is out the window.

2163
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,380
It's time to start thinking of a new one.

2164
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:14,010
It's crazy to think that my 
entire life started in this temple.

2165
01:38:14,010 --> 01:38:17,570
If I had never failed this 
one-block jump at the beginning,

2166
01:38:17,570 --> 01:38:20,860
I don't think I would have become 
the Parkour Champion that I am today.

2167
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:24,820
I might have just lived my life 
as a Parkour Pro, comfortable and happy.

2168
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,360
But where would be the fun in that?

2169
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:30,660
At least now I get a near-death experience every 
five minutes, and credit for saving the world.

2170
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:32,750
Hopefully <i>twice</i>, if I pull this one off.

2171
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:35,580
I made it up to the Pro level of Parkour Civilization.

2172
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:38,840
I looked around, and nothing seemed different, 
except for the fact that,

2173
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:41,390
well, the statue didn't have my head anymore.

2174
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:45,320
Alright, I'm gonna guess that was a personal 
design choice by the Parkour Villain himself.

2175
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:49,230
Just like the Noob layer, everything I remember 
from the Pro layer was gone.

2176
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:53,680
Except this layer was different, and now 
there were buildings that I've never seen before.

2177
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:56,380
This is the spot where all 
of the Pro houses should be,

2178
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:59,760
but now there's just one platform 
with parkour jumps on it.

2179
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:03,120
And not only that, the parkour jumps 
are identical to each other.

2180
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:06,050
This wasn't just a fight, this was a parkour race.

2181
01:39:06,050 --> 01:39:08,250
I thought back to what the Parkour Villain said.

2182
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:12,370
He said that he wanted to enlighten the world 
with his new form of parkour.

2183
01:39:12,370 --> 01:39:14,780
If I had to guess, I would say he did <i>just</i> that.

2184
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:18,150
All of the buildings surrounding 
the platform looked like prisons.

2185
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:21,460
But after checking every one of them, 
there was no one inside of them.

2186
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:22,650
No one was here.

2187
01:39:22,650 --> 01:39:26,050
I couldn't help but think of two 
terrible ideas of what happened.

2188
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:29,890
Either one, the Parkour Villain 
wiped out every Pro by himself,

2189
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:32,760
or two, he made the Parkour Pros fight each other.

2190
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:36,310
No matter what happened, the fact remains 
that the prison cells are empty.

2191
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:39,050
So that leaves me to believe that the Pros are gone.

2192
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:42,050
But that doesn't mean that the Parkour Masters are.

2193
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:46,300
If the outcomes I believe happened were true, 
it makes sense the Parkour Pros

2194
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:48,550
wouldn't stand a chance against the Parkour Villain.

2195
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:50,640
But the Parkour Masters know how to fight.

2196
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:54,280
And if they can fight, maybe there's a chance 
that they've been able to stay alive.

2197
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,830
I made it up to the Master level of civilization.

2198
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:58,240
Only one more layer and—

2199
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:00,400
Bro, really? My statue got destroyed again?

2200
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,770
Alright, once I get my hands back 
on the Command Blocks,

2201
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:04,080
I gotta build like 50 of those.

2202
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,230
Even though I was on the Master level of civilization,

2203
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:09,880
everything looked exactly 
the same as the layer below.

2204
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:14,160
The entire parkour city I worked so hard 
to make was completely wiped out,

2205
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:18,610
and once again replaced with a platform 
that had parkour race courses on it.

2206
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:20,510
I looked around, but didn't see anybody.

2207
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:24,120
But that's when I realized that these prisons 
were different than the layer below.

2208
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,810
All of these prison cells still had doors on them.

2209
01:40:26,810 --> 01:40:28,890
The Masters might still be alive.

2210
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:29,590
You.

2211
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,960
You just don't know when to give up, do you?

2212
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,750
Standing directly behind me was 
the Parkour Villain himself.

2213
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:40,530
I can only imagine you escaped 
with the help of the Parkour God.

2214
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:42,170
That is quite unfortunate.

2215
01:40:42,170 --> 01:40:45,720
I wasn't expecting the fight 
to get here so soon, but here it was.

2216
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:49,240
It's time to risk everything 
to save Parkour Civilization.

2217
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:50,800
All right, let's parkour race.

2218
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,210
This course right here.

2219
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:53,340
I'm afraid not.

2220
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:54,150
Wait, what?

2221
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:54,770
Why not?

2222
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:56,350
So now you're too scared to fight?

2223
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:59,600
What happened to all the stuff you 
were saying about willing to risk everything?

2224
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,750
Sounds to me like you think you're gonna lose.

2225
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:05,660
<i>You</i> of all people should know 
that course is below people like you and I.

2226
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:09,960
If I were to race you, the course would be terrifying.

2227
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,400
But I'm not going to.

2228
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:14,830
I'm just going to use the Command Blocks 
to wipe you out for good.

2229
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:18,430
You can try to stop me, 
but it looks like your hands are full.

2230
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:20,740
The Parkour Villain wasn't even gonna fight me.

2231
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:23,210
He was just gonna wipe me out 
with the Command Blocks.

2232
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:25,950
What did he mean when he said 
it looks like my hands are full?

2233
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:29,940
But at that moment, I heard something, 
and I looked over at one of the prison cells.

2234
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:34,010
One of the doors had opened, 
and standing in the doorway was a Parkour Master.

2235
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:35,630
He started jumping towards me.

2236
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:36,900
Hey, what's going on?

2237
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:37,540
Are you alright?

2238
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:39,940
What happened to all the other Parkour Masters?

2239
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:41,120
Are they still alive?

2240
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:45,940
I'm sorry, Evbo, but the new Champion 
has ordered me to race you in this parkour course.

2241
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:47,520
He ordered you to race me?

2242
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,660
Why would you do that??

2243
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:52,650
If I don't, he'll race me himself, 
and I don't wanna end up like the others.

2244
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:53,730
Then don't, okay?

2245
01:41:53,730 --> 01:41:57,340
Look, as soon as you challenge me 
to a parkour race, one of us will die.

2246
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:01,480
And you're not gonna beat me, so why don't you 
just give me time to defeat the Parkour Villain,

2247
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:02,760
and then we'll all be okay?

2248
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:04,830
Just don't challenge me and trust me.

2249
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:05,680
I can do this.

2250
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:09,590
I'm sorry, Evbo, but racing you seems 
like my best option to stay alive.

2251
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:11,650
I challenge you to a parkour race.

2252
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:15,350
And just like that, after those words 
were said, I could do nothing.

2253
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:20,100
Both of us were locked into a parkour race, 
meaning once one of us finishes the course,

2254
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:22,490
the other one will die no matter what.

2255
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:25,330
This is exactly what the Parkour Villain wanted.

2256
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:30,280
He introduced this illegal form of parkour 
and now he gets to watch and laugh

2257
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:33,600
as I fight to the death 
with the people that I'm trying to save.

2258
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,320
The worst part is is that the Parkour Villain knows

2259
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,680
that these Parkour Masters are no match for me.

2260
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:42,380
All he wants is to watch me 
suffer as I eliminate my friends.

2261
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:46,360
After doing the last two neo jumps, 
I knew the parkour race was over.

2262
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:49,330
Part of me wanted to just stop 
right here before the last jump

2263
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:51,910
and let the Parkour Master win, but I knew I couldn't.

2264
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:56,420
If I ended my journey right here, then no one 
would be able to stop the Parkour Villain,

2265
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,380
and many more lives would be lost.

2266
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:02,740
After I made the final jump of the parkour race, 
the Parkour Master was gone,

2267
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:04,250
and the fight was over.

2268
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:07,150
But the fight against 
the Parkour Villain hadn't even begun.

2269
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:10,690
If I don't get to the top 
of Parkour Civilization quickly enough,

2270
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:13,970
the villain will use the Command Blocks 
to delete me from this world,

2271
01:43:13,970 --> 01:43:16,190
and I'll have no chance to save these people.

2272
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:18,190
Which means there's no time to waste.

2273
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:21,280
The last time I saved the world, I <i>actually</i> had a plan.

2274
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:24,300
But now, I have no plan, no blocks to fight with,

2275
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:27,050
and I just realized I have no way up to the top.

2276
01:43:27,050 --> 01:43:28,210
Oh, I'm so done for.

2277
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:30,900
I didn't even realize 
that my Champion boots were gone,

2278
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:34,350
and only the Parkour Champion can see 
the path up to the top.

2279
01:43:34,350 --> 01:43:37,320
But that doesn't mean it's not here.

2280
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:39,360
Oh no, I have a really bad idea.

2281
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:42,580
Okay, I'm 99% sure this is 
where the first jump starts.

2282
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:45,080
If I get this wrong, well, it was a good life.

2283
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:48,520
I jumped into the air expecting 
to be falling, but I wasn't.

2284
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:51,440
The path to the top of Parkour Civilization was here.

2285
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,900
I just couldn't see it without my Champion boots on.

2286
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:57,510
If this idea didn't work, saving 
the world would have been impossible,

2287
01:43:57,510 --> 01:44:00,550
but now it's just slightly less impossible.

2288
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:02,750
Oh man, I have to do so many invisible jumps.

2289
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:04,530
Oh, this is not gonna be easy.

2290
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:08,780
Only thing I could do was rely on my memory 
of the parkour course up to the top.

2291
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:12,240
Luckily, I've made this journey numerous times 
over the course of my life,

2292
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:15,740
but still jumping on invisible blocks 
is <i>very</i> much not preferred.

2293
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:18,700
Only a few more jumps 
and I was inside the Parkour Temple,

2294
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:23,260
but with how long this journey has been taking, 
I feel like I could be deleted in any second.

2295
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:26,200
After all, the Parkour Villain does specialize in racing.

2296
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:29,590
I made the final jump, 
and I was inside the Parkour Temple.

2297
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:33,610
With no sign of the Parkour Villain, 
I can only assume he made it to the top,

2298
01:44:33,610 --> 01:44:35,340
which means this could be the end for me.

2299
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:40,180
Well, if I randomly disappear, 
I guess I get to add an invisible parkour course

2300
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:42,780
to my list of accomplishments, but I wasn't gone yet.

2301
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:45,600
I scaled the temple until I was at the very top.

2302
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:47,440
He must be on the Command Blocks, right?

2303
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,310
There's no way he—

2304
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:50,070
Wait, what... is that?

2305
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:53,480
On the other side of the Parkour Temple, 
there was some structure built,

2306
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,710
and the Parkour Villain was waiting for me.

2307
01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:58,170
So, I take it there's a reason I'm still alive?

2308
01:44:58,170 --> 01:45:00,560
What, did you wanna get one 
last supervillain monologue

2309
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,660
before you used the Command Blocks 
to wipe me out?

2310
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:05,040
I was never going to defeat you like that.

2311
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,850
I just needed you to follow me.

2312
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:11,690
Now, you will experience 
the true pain of a parkour race.

2313
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:14,660
I now realized what the structure in front of me was.

2314
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:19,560
It was a parkour race, and it would be my last chance 
to save Parkour Civilization.

2315
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:23,690
Some part of me was relieved because 
if I was gonna be deleted by the Command Blocks,

2316
01:45:23,690 --> 01:45:25,510
well, I had no plan to stop that.

2317
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:27,640
But now, the course of action is simple.

2318
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:29,520
Win the parkour race.

2319
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:33,290
This is without a doubt 
the most difficult race in parkour history.

2320
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:38,810
I want you to feel the sense of dread as you 
watch me get closer and closer to the finish line,

2321
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:43,150
knowing no matter how hard you try, 
you will never catch up to me.

2322
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:47,680
I commend you for making it this far, 
but I cannot entertain this any longer.

2323
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:49,010
Let's begin.

2324
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:50,080
This was it.

2325
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:56,100
The hardest parkour race in history against one of 
the most fearsome parkour fighters of all time.

2326
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,650
There's nothing to save me now.

2327
01:45:57,650 --> 01:45:59,340
Miss one jump and it's over.

2328
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:02,240
Make the jump slower 
than the Parkour Villain and I die.

2329
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:04,720
Meaning I can't hold anything back in this fight.

2330
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:07,480
Maybe I'm not good enough 
to beat the Parkour Villain,

2331
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:12,180
but someone once told me that as long 
as you can parkour, there is always a way.

2332
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:13,650
The parkour race had begun.

2333
01:46:13,650 --> 01:46:18,160
I did the first three jumps without stopping, 
but the Parkour Villain had matched my speed.

2334
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:20,550
This race was only gonna get more difficult,

2335
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:23,260
and the only way I could get 
a lead on the Parkour Villain

2336
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:26,710
is by doing the most difficult jumps 
with virtually no stopping.

2337
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:29,000
I barely stayed on after the ice block jump.

2338
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,200
And now it was time for a chain neo, 
which the Parkour Villain did effortlessly.

2339
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,570
I made the chain neo myself 
and made the drop down to the ladder.

2340
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:37,980
It was time to speed things up.

2341
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:42,250
I made a four-and-a-half block jump into 
a six-and-a-half block jump onto a candle.

2342
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:44,080
Now was my time to take the lead.

2343
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:48,170
I quickly made the two-block neo jump 
and immediately went onto the glass jumps.

2344
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:51,270
The Parkour Villain told me I lost 
the battle with him before

2345
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:53,970
because of my inability to risk everything I had.

2346
01:46:53,970 --> 01:46:57,430
But right now, in this battle, 
I wasn't holding anything back.

2347
01:46:57,430 --> 01:46:59,210
I stopped at a difficult neo jump.

2348
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:00,680
I needed momentum for this.

2349
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:04,040
I looked back and I had 
a sizable lead against the Parkour Villain.

2350
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:05,010
I could do this.

2351
01:47:05,010 --> 01:47:09,370
I went backwards one jump and used 
the momentum to make the three-block neo jump.

2352
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:10,440
This was my time.

2353
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:11,290
This was my—

2354
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:13,750
and that's when my heart dropped.

2355
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:17,080
The feeling of hope I had in this 
battle came and went in seconds.

2356
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:22,610
My side of the parkour battle wasn't finished 
and the end to the race was just a few jumps away.

2357
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:24,620
I was set up from the beginning.

2358
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:27,910
The Parkour Villain never 
intended on me finishing this race.

2359
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:31,040
He got what he wanted, 
and that was to make me suffer.

2360
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:35,280
All I could do from this point 
on was watch as my life slowly came to an end.

2361
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,420
This was how I was gonna go out.

2362
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:40,870
In a few jumps, the Parkour Villain 
would make it to the platform,

2363
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:42,930
and my life would cease to exist.

2364
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:47,330
To be honest, with everything that's happened 
in my life, I didn't think I would make it this far.

2365
01:47:47,330 --> 01:47:50,770
With every battle and every 
parkour course I've had to do,

2366
01:47:50,770 --> 01:47:53,350
I always thought that a jump would be my last.

2367
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:54,210
And you know what?

2368
01:47:54,210 --> 01:47:57,590
I've made some pretty 
impossible jumps, which is why

2369
01:47:57,590 --> 01:48:00,750
I'm not gonna leave Parkour Civilization
 by just standing still.

2370
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:04,550
I'm gonna end this journey with one final jump.

2371
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:09,520
So, this is what the end feels like.

2372
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,310
Wow, feels... weird.

2373
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:13,520
It feels like I'm still alive.

2374
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,170
No, but I'm probably dead, right?

2375
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:17,020
Yeah, I'm definitely dead.

2376
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:19,610
I mean, I jumped into the void. 
How would I <i>not</i> be dead?

2377
01:48:19,610 --> 01:48:22,440
You are very much still alive.

2378
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:26,330
In that moment, I heard a voice 
that I've heard one time in my life before.

2379
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:28,770
It was the voice of the Parkour God.

2380
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:31,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you say I'm alive?

2381
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:33,770
Wait, how is that even possible?

2382
01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:35,170
Why did you jump?

2383
01:48:35,170 --> 01:48:37,060
Why did I jump?

2384
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:41,190
You knew there was no block to land on, 
yet you jumped anyways.

2385
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:43,600
Well, I don't know. I mean, I had no options.

2386
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,300
And, didn't you hear my inner monologue?

2387
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:48,350
I kinda wanted that to be my 
last jump in Parkour Civilization.

2388
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:49,690
That's not it.

2389
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:53,640
<i>You</i> were prepared to sacrifice your life 
for Parkour Civilization.

2390
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:56,180
And perhaps <i>I</i> should do the same.

2391
01:48:56,180 --> 01:49:00,570
I'm sorry, uh, Mr. Parkour God, 
but if I'm still alive, does that mean

2392
01:49:00,570 --> 01:49:03,810
there's still a way I can go back and save the world?

2393
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:05,750
You may leave anytime you want.

2394
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:07,800
Just fail a jump and you can go back.

2395
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:10,260
I can go back and save everyone!

2396
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:11,490
Thank you, Parkour God.

2397
01:49:11,490 --> 01:49:13,330
I promise I won't waste this chance.

2398
01:49:13,330 --> 01:49:15,070
So eager to leave already?

2399
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:18,030
I guess my golly words are of no value to you.

2400
01:49:18,030 --> 01:49:19,000
No, no, no. That's not it.

2401
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,500
Sorry. I—I thought you were done.
 Please—please continue.

2402
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:27,060
Throughout my life, I have never bothered 
to interfere with the events of Parkour Civilization.

2403
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:31,450
I was afraid of what might happen 
if I were to introduce my power to the world.

2404
01:49:31,450 --> 01:49:35,370
Wait, but you gave me the Champion boots 
last time I needed to save the world.

2405
01:49:35,370 --> 01:49:36,750
Didn't you interfere then?

2406
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:38,410
I was merely a messenger.

2407
01:49:38,410 --> 01:49:41,040
The old man wanted his boots to go to you.

2408
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,180
And all I did was deliver them.

2409
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:45,370
So why tell me all of this?

2410
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:46,520
And why bring me here?

2411
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:49,690
Because I have found my successor.

2412
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:54,850
You have convinced me that there are 
those in this world worthy of wielding my power.

2413
01:49:54,850 --> 01:50:00,450
And you will continue my legacy by inheriting 
this power and passing it onto future generations.

2414
01:50:00,450 --> 01:50:02,020
Whoa, okay, hold on.

2415
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:04,430
You said <i>I</i> will inherit your power?

2416
01:50:04,430 --> 01:50:05,830
What power is <i>that</i>?

2417
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:08,310
You will <i>become parkour.</i>

2418
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:10,990
I'm sorry, did you just say "<i>become parkour?</i>"

2419
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:12,800
That doesn't make any sense.

2420
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,210
I'm a godly figure that rarely shows up.

2421
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:17,160
I'm not supposed to make any sense.

2422
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:20,720
And just like that, the Parkour God 
vanished into thin air.

2423
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:23,520
I'm gonna inherit the Parkour God's power?

2424
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:24,630
What does this even mean?

2425
01:50:24,630 --> 01:50:27,030
Okay, I guess now is not the time 
to think about it too much.

2426
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:31,370
All that matters now is that I can 
finish this race and save the world.

2427
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:34,220
From the beginning, 
I've always had to jump to survive.

2428
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:36,170
And well, I'm still jumping.

2429
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:49,680
Oh!

2430
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:51,550
How... did I just do that?

2431
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:54,080
Did the Parkour God just put the ladder here for me?

2432
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,420
Oh, I am still alive.

2433
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:56,530
I am still alive.

2434
01:50:56,530 --> 01:50:57,440
How is this possible?

2435
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:59,360
Wait, netherite boots?

2436
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:01,880
No, <i>I'm </i>the one who made the ladder.

2437
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:03,720
What?

2438
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:05,030
That's impossible.

2439
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:06,090
Hahaha!

2440
01:51:06,090 --> 01:51:08,380
No, it is definitely possible.

2441
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:10,290
Now, let's see how this works.

2442
01:51:10,290 --> 01:51:11,770
All right, just place as I go.

2443
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:14,520
This is what parkour should feel like.

2444
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:15,810
Okay, what do we have here?

2445
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:17,150
I think I can build all that.

2446
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:19,290
I can see the finish line.

2447
01:51:19,290 --> 01:51:20,700
I'm not giving up now.

2448
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:22,650
Come on, just five more jumps.

2449
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:24,020
Let's do this.

2450
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:38,070
Oh, it's over.

2451
01:51:38,070 --> 01:51:39,610
Oh my gosh, it's over.

2452
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:41,990
Oh, that one really came down to the wire.

2453
01:51:41,990 --> 01:51:44,400
I kind of wish someone saw that 360 at the end.

2454
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,490
That was kinda cool.

2455
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:47,240
Oh, my body is sore.

2456
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:49,210
My shoulder kind of hurts from that ladder clutch.

2457
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:50,160
Should it be hurting?

2458
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,770
I thought I'm the Parkour God now.

2459
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:53,440
I feel like I shouldn't be able to feel pain.

2460
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,050
Can... I even die?

2461
01:51:55,050 --> 01:51:56,460
Should I test it out right now?

2462
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,760
No, no, that's a terrible idea.

2463
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:58,890
I should not test that out.

2464
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:02,910
Man, why do the Command Blocks 
have to be a four-block jump?

2465
01:52:02,910 --> 01:52:03,810
It's not that hard.

2466
01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:04,760
Come on, you'll get used to it.

2467
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:06,450
Besides, you're the new Parkour Champion.

2468
01:52:06,450 --> 01:52:08,020
You should be doing that in your sleep.

2469
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:09,600
All right, let's see how this attempt went.

2470
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:11,560
Eh, nope, you still messed it up again.

2471
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:16,910
Okay, so this time you built <i>barely</i> half a house, 
and it's also like 50 blocks up in the air.

2472
01:52:16,910 --> 01:52:17,990
That's fine, don't sweat it.

2473
01:52:17,990 --> 01:52:19,580
Not everyone gets it on their first try.

2474
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:20,300
I don't get it.

2475
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:23,320
I'm thinking of a house, 
and it's not building the house.

2476
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:25,800
Why are these things so hard to use?

2477
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,790
Yeah, it's more of an imagination thing.

2478
01:52:27,790 --> 01:52:29,280
I don't know. You just gotta think harder.

2479
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:31,058
I mean, I got it on my first try. Haha.

2480
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:32,570
Yeah, of course you did, bro.

2481
01:52:32,570 --> 01:52:37,270
So what are you gonna do now that 
the world doesn't need saving anymore?

2482
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:39,890
What are you supposed to do as the Parkour God?

2483
01:52:39,890 --> 01:52:40,760
That's the thing.

2484
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:43,050
I don't have to do anything.

2485
01:52:43,050 --> 01:52:45,360
If the world needs saving, I'll be there to save it.

2486
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:47,450
But for now, I just wanna parkour.

2487
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:49,380
I've been a Parkour Noob.

2488
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:51,150
I've been a Parkour Pro.

2489
01:52:51,150 --> 01:52:52,440
I've been a Master.

2490
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:54,110
And I've been a Parkour Champion.

2491
01:52:54,110 --> 01:52:57,250
And every one of those roles came with expectations

2492
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:59,470
about where I should go or what I should do.

2493
01:52:59,470 --> 01:53:03,650
But now the only one 
to decide those things for me is myself.

2494
01:53:03,650 --> 01:53:06,370
So all I'm gonna do is parkour

2495
01:53:06,370 --> 01:53:10,640
and if that leads me back to saving 
Parkour Civilization again, then so be it.

2496
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:13,810
From now on, the only path I'm following is my own.

2497
01:53:13,810 --> 01:53:15,730
I make my own jumps.

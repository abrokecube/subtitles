very epic subs

`charisma picnic.ass` is the base file before trimming the fat (optimizations)  
`charisma picnic_opt.ass` is the file after optimization (simplifying shapes using `Shapery>Manipulate` and running `ASSWipe`) but with loads of extradata  
`charisma picnic_opt_nodata.ass` is the file after stripping all extradata (using aegisub 'export' function) and is the file I submitted to nekocap

If you would like to make your own changes, I recommend editing `charisma picnic_opt.ass`
